# Paper {#paper}

The necessary components of the report are below.
You are free to add additional sections as necessary.
I intend that you are able to pull in much of this information from the previous three components of this project (the proposal, descriptive statistics, and results).
However, you must edit to ensure that the report reads well as a cohesive whole, and you must also address any relevant feedback you received on those components.
**You must not simply paste your three previous assignments together in one document; this will not score well.**

Be selective in what you include in your final write-up.
The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.

## Timeline

Bring a full draft to class on **Thursday June 22** for peer review.
The final revised draft is due on **Wednesday June 28, 11:59pm**.

## Overall requirements

-   Your full paper must be completed in the `report.qmd` file and must be reproducible.
    Before you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is off with the option `echo: false` in the YAML.

-   The complete paper, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long.
    There is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis in your report.

-   You must include and interpret at least one figure that usefully displays your data. You may choose where it makes most sense to include this.

## Paper sections

### Introduction

This section includes an introduction to the project motivation and research question.

#### Grading criteria

The research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research.
The research question is well formulated and the data set fits the question.
The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report.

### Data and methodology

This section includes a brief description of your data and your analysis process.
Describe the data and variables you will use in analysis.
Be clear about what purpose your variables serve and how they are operationalized.
Explain your analysis strategy and why this strategy is appropriate for your question and variables.
Though you may show descriptive analysis, you should go beyond it--ie, you should use one or more of the hypothesis testing techniques we have discussed in class.

#### Grading criteria

The analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question.

### Results

This is where you will discuss your overall finding and describe the key results from your analysis.
Present the results of your analysis using figures and/or tables, as appropriate.
The goal is not to interpret every single element of an output shown, but instead to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions.
Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.

#### Grading criteria

The analysis results are clearly assessed and interesting findings from the analysis are described.
Interpretations are used to to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing, e.g., the interpretation of every model coefficient.

### Discussion

In this section you'll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions.
In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved.
Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here.
In short, describe what your results reveal about the research question, as well as what they *do not* say.
Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.

#### Grading criteria

Overall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the analysis results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question.
There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.

### Organization + formatting

This is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.

#### Grading criteria

The report is neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels.
Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted.
All citations and links are properly formatted.
All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed.
The paper is no longer than 10 pages.

## Report grading

The final paper grade is broken down as follows.
