# Descriptive Statistics {#descriptives}

In this component of your project, you will explore the variables you will use in your analysis.

## How to complete and submit (due Monday, June 5, 11:59pm)

First, locate and clone the component 2 repository ([instructions](https://soc333-sum23.github.io/computing-clonerepo.html)).
Go to our [course github organization](https://github.com/orgs/soc333-sum23/repositories) and find the repository called **c2_descriptives_yourusername**.
Clone that repository.
Open the document called *c2_descriptives.qmd*.
This is a template document where you will put your work.

Commit your changes regularly.
When you are done, render the document and submit by pushing your work to github ([instructions](https://soc333-sum23.github.io/computing-clonerepo.html#how-to-commit-and-push-changes))

## Details

### Part 1: Understanding your variables

    -   Write down your research question (from component 1)
    -   Write down your hypothesis (from component 1)
    -   Write down the names of the variables you will use in your analysis (i.e., what you need to type to access them in R)
    -   For each variable, write:
        -   Whether it is an explanatory (independent) variable, a response (dependent) variable, or something else (if something else, explain what purpose it serves)
        -   What kind of variable it is (categorical or numeric and which subtype within these)
        -   What the range or possible responses are

### Part 2: Univariate distributions

    -   For each of your variables:
        -   Run the `summary()` (for numeric variables) or `table()` (for categorical variables) function on the variable. Describe the results. Does anything about them surprise you?
        -   Note how many missing values (NAs) there are. Hint: use the `useNA = "always"` option if using `table()`.
        
###  Part 3: Multivariate visualizations

    -   Make a plot showing the relationship between your explanatory (independent) and response (dependent) variables. Depending on your variable types, this could be a scatter plot, box plot, bar chart, etc.
    -   Interpret your plot in \~2-3 sentences. Does it appear these variables are associated with one another? Does anything about the relationship surprise you? Is it consistent or inconsistent with your hypothesis?

## Why?

Before doing any inferential statistics, you should always get a good understanding of what the distributions of your variables look like.
This will help you head off problems later.
For example, looking at the distributions of your variables will reveal if data is missing when you don't expect it to be.
It also might clue you in on interesting patterns you may want to investigate further.
Looking at bivariate associations between variables gives you a sense of what the relationship between them looks like, which will help you interpret inferential statistics.
