# Proposal {#proposal}

## Details

In this component, you will think through two possible research questions and data sets.
Using the feedback provided by your classmates, you will choose one to pursue further.

### Data

You will need to find two data sets: one for each of your research questions.
You may write additional research questions on a single data set if you would like additional feedback, but in all cases, you must consider and present at least two data sets in total.
In other words, additional questions on a single data set are extra; they do not count towards your required two questions.

I highly recommend selecting [data sets included with the openintro package](https://www.openintro.org/data/).
There is all kinds of interesting data freely available on the internet, but it is a good idea to stick with openintro because their data sets are clean and easy to work with.
We already have a lot to do in just 6 weeks, and so will not be covering how to prepare "messy" data for analysis (I recommend a data science course like STA 199 for this!).
If you really, really want to use a data set from elsewhere, talk to me.

Not all openintro data sets will work for this course because not all of them lend themselves to sociological questions (see below for research question requirements--they must have to do with people living in a social system).
Choose data sets that have something to do with people, that contain real (not simulated, not demo) data, and that contain a bare minimum of 50 cases and two interesting variables.
Avoid data sets that are used extensively to demonstrate concepts in the textbook.
You may not choose questions that are similar to or the same as those used as book examples.

The below data sets are good places to start, though you may propose others so long as they allow you to write a research question about people and the social systems they live in.

### Version to bring to class for peer review (Thursday May 25)

You are required to propose a minimum of 2 research questions, to be answered with 2 separate data sets, that you're interested in potentially using for the final project.
If you would like to receive feedback on more than two research questions, you may optionally submit additional questions.
You will review each others' proposals in groups of 2-3.
After peer review, you will be responsible for updating your draft and submitting for grading according to the requirements below.

For each research question, you should:

-   Clearly state the specific research question.
    Make sure it fulfills the following requirements:

    -   Must be specific and well-formulated (see slides LINK)
    -   Must involve a relationship between at least two variables
    -   Must be *sociological* in some way--this is a sociology class, after all. In other words, it has to have something to do with people living in a social system. If you are not sure whether your question meets this requirement, ask!

-   Additionally, provide some supporting information:

    -   What is your target population?
    -   Write \~1 paragraph giving any necessary background information and explaining why the question is interesting to study.
    -   Write down a hypothesis stating what you expect to find. Give a brief (\~1-2 sentence) justification for why you expect this.

-   Identify the data set you would use to answer the research question and provide some information about it.
    Address the following questions:

    -   When and how was it originally collected?
    -   Is it an observational study or an experiment?
    -   Who or what was sampled, and how many cases are there?
    -   What variables would you use to answer your question?
    -   Why is this data set a good fit for your research question?
    -   Briefly (in \~2-3 sentences) address any ethical concerns. If none, explain why there are none.

-   Provide a glimpse of your data

    -   Place the file containing your data in the `data` folder of the project repo.
    -   Use the `glimpse()` function to provide a glimpse of the data set.

### Version to submit for grading (Tuesday May 30, 11:59pm)

After peer review, incorporate your peers' feedback into your draft.
In addition, add \~1 paragraph of thoughts about which question you should ultimately choose to move forward with.
In that paragraph, answer the following questions:

-   Which question do you think you should pursue for your final project?
-   Why is this the right choice? Discuss fit between the research question and data set, feasibility, and value of the research question.

Submit one Quarto document containing your revised research questions and this summary paragraph.

Each component will be graded as follows:

-   **Meets expectations (full credit)**: All required elements are completed and are accurate.
    The narrative is written clearly, all tables and visualizations are nicely formatted, and the work would be presentable in a professional setting.

-   **Close to expectations (half credit)**: There are some elements missing and/or inaccurate.
    There are some issues with formatting.

-   **Does not meet expectations (no credit)**: Major elements missing.
    Work is not neatly formatted and would not be presentable in a professional setting.

It is critical to check feedback on your project proposal.
Even if you earn full credit, it may not mean that your proposal is perfect.
Just like you are expected to incorporate feedback from your peers into your graded proposal, you will be expected to incorporate feedback from me into the relevant sections of your final paper.
The degree to which you address feedback will be a component of your final paper grade.

## Why?

There are three main purposes of the project proposal:

-   To get you thinking about the project early so you can get a head start on refining your question, finding your data, and doing your analysis.
-   To ensure that the data you wish to analyze, methods you plan to use, and the scope of your analysis are feasible and will allow you to be successful.
-   To give you practice talking about analysis ideas and plans with your peers.
