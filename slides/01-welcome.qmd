# What we'll do: an example

## Let's meet some data!

-   Equity in Athletics Data Analytics

![](images/01/datapdf.png)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sportspeople <- readRDS("data/sports_npeople.rds")

dukecoaches <- sportspeople |> 
  filter(school == "Duke",
         year == 2021) |> 
  group_by(teamgender, coachgender, coachlevel, assignstatus) |> 
  summarize(n = sum(ncoaches))

coachesperteam <- sportspeople |> 
  filter(school == "Duke", 
         year == 2021) |> 
  group_by(teamgender, assignstatus, sport, nplayers) |> 
  summarize(totalcoaches = sum(ncoaches)) |> 
  mutate(playercoachratio = nplayers/totalcoaches)

```

# Description

## How many coaches were there at Duke in 2021?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dukecoaches2021 <- sportspeople |> 
  filter(school == "Duke", 
         year == 2021) |> 
  group_by(teamgender) |> 
  summarize(totalcoaches = sum(ncoaches))

mensteamcoaches <- dukecoaches2021$totalcoaches[[1]]
womensteamcoaches <- dukecoaches2021$totalcoaches[[2]]
```

-   `r mensteamcoaches` for men's teams
-   `r womensteamcoaches` for women's teams

## How has that changed since 2003?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
coachesovertime <- sportspeople |> 
  filter(school == "Duke") |> 
  group_by(year, teamgender) |> 
  summarize(totalcoaches = sum(ncoaches)) |> 
  mutate(teamgender = factor(teamgender, levels = c("women", "men")))

coachtimeplot <- ggplot(coachesovertime, aes(x = year, y = totalcoaches, color = teamgender)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(y = "Number of coaches",
       x = "Year",
       title = "Change in number of Duke coaches over time",
       color = "Team gender")

coachtimeplot
```

## How are male and female coaches distributed between men's and women's teams?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
genderdist <- sportspeople |> 
  filter(school == "Duke",
         year == 2021) |> 
  group_by(teamgender, coachgender, coachlevel) |> 
  summarize(totalcoaches = sum(ncoaches)) |> 
  ungroup() 

genderdist_complete <- genderdist |> 
  expand(teamgender, coachgender, coachlevel) |> 
  full_join(genderdist) |> 
  replace_na(list(totalcoaches = 0)) |> 
  mutate(coachgender = factor(coachgender, levels = c("women", "men")),
         coachlevel = factor(ifelse(coachlevel == "head", "Head coaches", "Assistant coaches"),
                             levels = c("Head coaches", "Assistant coaches")),
         teamgender = factor(
           ifelse(teamgender == "men", "Men's teams", "Women's teams"),
           levels = c("Women's teams", "Men's teams")
         )
  )

ggplot(filter(genderdist_complete, coachlevel == "Head coaches"), aes(y = totalcoaches, x = coachgender, fill = coachgender)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(teamgender)) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Coach gender",
       y = "Number of coaches",
       fill = "Head coach gender",
       title = "Head coaches") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(filter(genderdist_complete, coachlevel == "Assistant coaches"), aes(y = totalcoaches, x = coachgender, fill = coachgender)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(teamgender)) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Assistant coach gender",
       y = "Number of coaches",
       fill = "Assistant coach gender",
       title = "Assistant coaches") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(genderdist_complete, aes(y = totalcoaches, x = coachgender, fill = coachgender)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(teamgender),
             rows = vars(coachlevel)) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Coach gender",
       y = "Number of coaches",
       fill = "Coach gender",
       title = "All coaches") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# Inference

## Do women and men have the same probability of being hired for coaching jobs?

-   It depends on the job!

```{r}
genderdist_t <- genderdist_complete |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = coachgender, values_from = totalcoaches)

genderdist_t[1, 'p'] <- prop.test(x = as.matrix(genderdist_t[1, 3:4]))$p.value
genderdist_t[2, 'p'] <- prop.test(x = as.matrix(genderdist_t[2, 3:4]))$p.value
genderdist_t[3, 'p'] <- prop.test(x = as.matrix(genderdist_t[3, 3:4]))$p.value
genderdist_t[4, 'p'] <- prop.test(x = as.matrix(genderdist_t[4, 3:4]))$p.value

genderdist_t$sig <- ifelse(genderdist_t$p < .05, "yes", "no")

genderdist_sig <- genderdist_t |> 
  pivot_longer(names_to = 'coachgender', 
               values_to = 'totalcoaches',
               cols = c("men", "women")) |> 
  mutate(coachgender = factor(coachgender, levels = c("women", "men")))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(genderdist_sig, aes(y = totalcoaches, x = coachgender, fill = coachgender, alpha = sig)) + 
 geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
 facet_grid(cols = vars(teamgender),
 rows = vars(coachlevel)) + 
 theme_minimal() + 
 labs(x = "Coach gender",
 y = "Number of coaches",
 fill = "Coach gender",
 title = "All coaches") + 
 theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# Interpretation

## Why might this be?

## What explanations might our data be able to speak to?

# How we'll do it: technology

## Why not these?

|                         |                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| ![](images/01/ti84.jpg) | ![](images/01/excel.png) |

## Why not these?

-   Limited functionality

-   Work is not reproducible

-   Expensive!

## Instead! R and RStudio

![](images/01/rstudio.png){fig-alt="An RStudio window" fig-align="center"}

## Instead! R and RStudio

-   Completely reproducible and open-source

-   Lots of flexibility, and capabilities are always expanding

-   A great resume line--it's what the pros use

-   Free!

See [course syllabus](https://soc333-sum23.github.io/course-syllabus.html#grading) for how the final letter grade will be determined.

## [Support](https://soc333-sum23.github.io/course-support.html)

-   Attend office hours! 30 min before/after class
-   Ask questions in class
-   Email for individual matters. aidan.combs\@duke.edu
-   Lots of [resources available through the university](https://soc333-sum23.github.io/course-support.html#academic-support)--use them!

## Announcements

-   Posted on Sakai (Announcements tool) and sent via email, be sure to check both regularly
-   I'll assume that you've read an announcement by the next "business" day
-   I'll (try my best to) send a weekly update announcement each Friday, outlining the plan for the following week and reminding you what you need to do.

## Diversity + inclusion {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

::: incremental
-   Please let me know your preferred name and pronouns on the Getting to know you survey.
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisors and deans are excellent resources.
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
:::

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better.
    If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

# Course policies

## COVID policies

-   Masks are optional

-   If you're sick, please stay home

-   Read and follow university guidance

## Late work, waivers, regrades policy

-   We have policies!
-   Read about them on the [course syllabus](https://soc333-sum23.github.io/course-syllabus.html#course-policies) and refer back to them when you need it

## Collaboration policy

-   Everything you submit for grading in this course should be completed individually.

-   However, you will be working together frequently to provide feedback on each others' final projects.

## Sharing / reusing code policy

-   I know that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted.
    ChatGPT may (or may not) also be able to write code that is useful to you.

-   Programmers use online resources to help them accomplish tasks all the time--these sources can be extremely helpful for learning *when used well.*

    -   What does this mean? Use them to learn. Don't blindly copy/paste; it won't work. We'll talk more about this soon.

-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow, ChatGPT, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).

-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source

## Academic integrity

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
>
> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
>
> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
>
> -   I will act if the Standard is compromised.

## Most importantly!

Ask if you're not sure if something violates a policy!

## This week's tasks

-   Before tomorrow: read IMS ch 1

-   Before Monday: complete HW 1 (getting oriented to R)

## Let's get started!

-   In-class exercise 1: let's get set up with GitHub!

-   Get a GitHub account if you don't have one (some advice for choosing a username [here](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice "Happy Git with R"))

-   Complete the Getting to know you survey if you haven't yet done so!

-   Read the syllabus
