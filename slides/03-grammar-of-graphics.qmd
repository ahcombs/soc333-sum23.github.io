# Data visualization

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(countdown)
```

## **Examining data visualization** {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Discuss the following for the visualization.

-   What is the visualization trying to show?

-   What is effective, i.e. what is done well?

-   What is ineffective, i.e. what could be improved?

-   What are you curious about after looking at the visualization?

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 4, left = 0, color_text = "#325b74")
```

## Recap of AE {.smaller}

-   Construct plots with `ggplot()`.
-   Layers of ggplots are separated by `+`s.
-   The formula is (almost) always as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggplot(DATA, aes(x = X-VAR, y = Y-VAR, ...)) +
  geom_XXX()
```

-   Aesthetic attributes of a geometries (color, size, transparency, etc.) can be **map**ped to variables in the data or **set** by the user, e.g. `color = binary` vs. `color = "pink"`.
-   Use `facet_wrap()` when faceting (creating small multiples) by one variable and `facet_grid()` when faceting by two variables.
