## Logistics {.smaller}

-   Project component 2: descriptive statistics

    -   Due **Thursday June 8** 11:59pm
    -   this is the last time it's moving--thank you for your patience. :)

## Today {.smaller}

-   Getting help with R
-   Single variable plots
-   Factors

## Finding help in R

-   #1: Your classmates and I!

    -   Copy/pasting from slides or exercises and editing the pieces you need is a good strategy

. . .

-   Documentation! Use `?`

```{r}
?median
```

## Finding help in R

-   Cheatsheets!

    -   Relevant ones are on the course website: [Computing -\> Cheatsheets](https://soc333-sum23.github.io/computing-cheatsheets.html)
    -   More at <https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/>

. . .

-   Google!

    -   Try "how to calculate the median in r" rather than "r how to calculate median"
    -   StackOverflow/StackExchange is good
    -   Paste in your error message
    -   **Cite your sources**

. . .

-   A book!

    -   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## Finding help in R

-   Campus resources!

    -   [Center for Data Visualization Sciences](https://library.duke.edu/data/about)
    -   [Innovation CoLab](https://colab.duke.edu/)
    -   [Social Science Research Institute (SSRI) consults](https://ssri.duke.edu/research/consulting-training/)

. . .

-   ChatGPT??

. . .

```         
-   ...eh. It can WRITE code, but it can't test it... 
-   So what it gives you probably won't work, or won't work correctly, at least not right out of the box
-   Might be useful for inspiration/finding a starting place, but not for doing your work for you (just like with writing!)
-   **Cite your sources**

# Plotting a single variable

## Categorical data: bar charts

```{r, echo = FALSE}
acs12 |> 
  filter(!is.na(employment)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = employment)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(y = "",
       x = "Labor force status")
```

## Numeric data: histograms

```{r, echo = FALSE}
acs12 |> 
  filter(!is.na(hrs_work)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = hrs_work)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + 
  labs(y = "Number of people",
       x = "Hours worked per week")
```

## How? With ggplot!

The basic structure of a plot:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = DATASET, aes(x = X.VARIABLE, 
                           y = Y.VARIABLE,
                           OTHER.STUFF)) + 
  geom_XXXX()
```

## Back to the bar chart

```{r}
ggplot(data = acs12, # we want to plot the acs12 dataset
       aes(x = employment)) + # and specifically the employment variable, which should be on the x axis
  geom_bar() # and we want that plot to be a bar chart
```

. . .

-   It's there but it's ugly!

## Cleaning up the bar chart

-   Once we have a basic plot, we can add code to make it nicer

```{r}
ggplot(data = acs12, aes(x = employment)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  # this changes our axis labels
  labs(y = "", # make the y axis labels blank
       x = "Labor force status") # Change the x axis label
```

## Cleaning up the bar chart

-   What about that NA bar?
-   There are NAs in our plot because there are NAs in our data set

```{r}
table(acs12$employment, useNA = "always")
```

## Cleaning up the bar chart

-   We can use `filter()` to get rid of them before plotting the data

```{r}
# first we filter out the NAs
acs12_filtered <- filter(acs12, !is.na(employment))

# then we plot that new dataset
ggplot(data = acs12_filtered, aes(x = employment)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(y = "", 
       x = "Labor force status",
       # and let's add a title too
       title = "Number of people in each employment category"
       ) 
```

## Cleaning up the bar chart

-   We could have also used a pipe to do the same thing in one command

```{r}
# we start with acs12
acs12 |> 
  # then we filter out the NAs
  filter(!is.na(employment)) |> 
  # then we make our plot
  ggplot(aes(x = employment)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(y = "", 
       x = "Labor force status",
       # and let's add a title too
       title = "Number of people in each employment category"
  ) 
```

## Back to the histogram

-   It has exactly the same structure!

```{r}
ggplot(data = acs12, aes(x = hrs_work)) + 
  #notice that the geom is different--this is what specifies what kind of plot you want
  geom_histogram()
```

## Cleaning up the histogram

-   Two messages come up:

    -   `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
    -   Warning: Removed 1041 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).

. . .

-   Let's start with the second one

    -   When there are NA variables in categorical variables, R plots them as another category, in their own bar
    -   But when there are NA variables in numeric variables, R doesn't know what to do
    -   So here it's warning us that it dropped "non-finite" (ie, NA) values itself

## Cleaning up the histogram

-   It's better if we do that explicitly though
-   Same as the bar chart, let's filter out the NAs before plotting

```{r}
acs_filtered <- filter(acs12, !is.na(hrs_work))

ggplot(data = acs_filtered, aes(x = hrs_work)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

## Cleaning up the histogram

-   Now what about that other message?

    -   `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

```{r}
# Hmm. Let's check the function documentation. 
# Since it didn't give us this message last time, 
# it must have something to do with the histogram function.
?geom_histogram
```

## Cleaning up the histogram

-   The function documentation tells us that geom_histogram gives you two ways to set the width of the bars: `bins` and `binwidth`.

    -   `binwidth` sets the width of each bar: eg, each bar should represent 5 hours worked, or 10
    -   We could use `bins` instead to tell R how many bars there should be--10 bars, 20 bars, etc

-   The message is telling us that R took its best dumb guess, but we should pick something better.

## Cleaning up the histogram

```{r}
acs_filtered <- filter(acs12, !is.na(hrs_work))

ggplot(data = acs_filtered, aes(x = hrs_work)) + 
  # the binwidth argument goes inside the geom_histogram function
  # let's say that each bar should equal five hours--so 0-5 hours, 5-10, etc
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) 
```

## Cleaning up the histogram

-   What if we picked 8 instead? (logic being that 8 is a standard workday)

```{r}
acs_filtered <- filter(acs12, !is.na(hrs_work))

ggplot(data = acs_filtered, aes(x = hrs_work)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) 
```

## Cleaning up the histogram

-   What about 1?

```{r}
acs_filtered <- filter(acs12, !is.na(hrs_work))

ggplot(data = acs_filtered, aes(x = hrs_work)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) 
```

## Cleaning up the histogram

-   Now we've eliminated all the messages--let's add labels!

```{r}
acs_filtered <- filter(acs12, !is.na(hrs_work))

ggplot(data = acs_filtered, aes(x = hrs_work)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + 
  labs(x = "Number of hours worked per week",
       y = "Number of people",
       title = "Distribution of hours worked per week",
       subtitle = "American Community Survey 2012")
```

# Exercise: Plotting one variable

# Factors

## Factors

-   Remember our bar plot of helmet wearing habits from the exercise:

```{r}
ggplot(data = yrbss, aes(x = helmet_12m)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

## Factors

-   Categorical variables (those where the values are words/letters/numbers in quotation marks) default to being ordered alphabetically

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = yrbss, aes(x = helmet_12m)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
glimpse(yrbss)
```
:::
:::

## Factors

-   But we can change that!
-   *Factors* are a specific type of R object. They are categorical with response options that are represented by words/letters/numbers in quotation marks, but they allow you to assign those options any order you'd like.
-   Useful for ordinal variables
-   To change the order of the bars, we change the order of the response options in the data set before we plot.

## Factors

-   We can use `mutate()` with a new function, `factor()`, for this.

```{r}
table(yrbss$helmet_12m, useNA = "always")
```

```{r}
yrbss_reordered <- mutate(yrbss,
                          # we are turning our helmet variable into a factor
                          # its name will remain the same (the new variable 
                          # we create will overwrite the old one)
                          helmet_12m = factor(
                            helmet_12m, 
                            # and we want its response options to be in this order
                            # least to greatest frequency
                            levels = c("did not ride", "never", "rarely", 
                                       "sometimes", "most of time", "always")))

table(yrbss_reordered$helmet_12m)
```

## Factors

-   Our new plot! I've added better labels as well.
-   What is easier to see in this plot than the old one?
-   Does the pattern surprise you?

```{r}
ggplot(data = yrbss_reordered, aes(x = helmet_12m)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(x = "How frequently did you wear a helmet while riding your bike?",
       y = "Number of students",
       title = "Distribution of reported helmet wearing in the last 12 months")
```
