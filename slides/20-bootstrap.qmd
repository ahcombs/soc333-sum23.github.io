## Checklist

-- Clone `ae-17`

## Announcements

-- HW 5 (Due Thursday)

-- Project Proposal (Due Friday)

## Project Hints

-- Reference the AEs and Videos for example research questions

-- Make sure your variable is not an *id*

-- Write yourself a project outline

-   What is the topic?

-   Why do we care?

-   What are we interested in?


## Goals

-- What is bootstrapping

-- What is a confidence interval

## Warm Up: Remember the Penguins

$\widehat{body.mass} = -5781 + 49.7 \times flipper.length$

-- What does this line tell us? 

## 

$body.mass = \beta_o + \beta_1 \times flipper.length$ - Population Model 

What is $\beta_1$?

Does our estimated line tell us what $\beta_1$ ?

## Population Parameters 

-- $\beta_1$?

-- $\mu$

-- $\pi$

## This week

-- Is all about **concepts**

-- Main goal is to develop a fundamental understanding about bootstrapping, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.

We will put our understanding into more practice starting next week.

# ae-19 - Bootstrap

## In Summary

-   Bootstrap methods are simulation methods

-   Variability - *Uncertainty*: How spread out your data are

-   We can use this to guess plausible values around our parameter of interest

-   This is called a confidence interval, and it's different than probability
