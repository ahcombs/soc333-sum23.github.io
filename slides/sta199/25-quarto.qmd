# Warm up

## Course evaluations {.smaller}

-   Your investment in completing the course and TA evaluation thoughtfully for about 10 minutes today will not only help instructors improve their courses, but their instruction techniques as well.

-   Most of the ratings and responses you provide in your evaluations this semester will be shared with future students.
    The more students that contribute evaluations, the more access every student will have to course evaluation data when making future course enrollment decisions.

-   You can address the evaluation forms through links in email reminders or by logging in to [duke.evaluationkit.com](https://duke.evaluationkit.com/) (for course evaluations).

-   Goal: If we can hit 80% response rate on [**both**]{.underline} course and TA evaluations, everyone in the class will get an additional point on their HW average.

## Project presentations on Monday! ðŸ¥³ {.smaller}

-   Make sure your presentation is pushed to your GitHub repo before your lab section.

-   Get to lab on time, 5 minutes prior if possible -- **all team members must be present in class and take part in the presentation + Q&A**

-   Find out your presentation order when you get there.

-   Deliver or play your 5-minute presentation.

-   Answer questions during your own Q&A or ask questions to others.

-   Fill out feedback forms while you listen to others' presentations.

## Project write-ups due Thursday

-   There's a good chance you'll be done with these on Monday as well

-   But you might want to improve your write-up based on inspiration from other teams' presentations and/or ideas that came up during your Q&A.

-   Project repos will close at 11:59pm on Thursday.
    There is no Gradescope submission, just push your final edits to GitHub.

# Quarto demos

## Writing your project report with Quarto

-   Figure sizing: `fig-width`, `fig-height`, etc. in code chunks.

-   Figure layout: `layout-ncol` for placing multiple figures in a chunk.

-   Further control over figure layout with the **patchwork** package.

-   Chunk options around what makes it in your final report: `message`, `echo`, etc.

-   Citations.

-   Finalizing your report with `echo: false`.

## Building your project website with Quarto

-   The `docs` folder.

-   Making sure your website reflects your latest changes.

-   Customizing the look of your website.

## The presentation

-   **Option 1:** Make your slides not in Quarto but make sure they're available in your Quarto project website.

-   **Option 2:** Make your slides with Quarto.
