# Misrepresentation

## Stand your ground {.smaller}

::: question
In 2005, the [*Florida legislature*](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Florida%20legislature) passed the controversial ["Stand Your Ground" law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law) that broadened the situations in which citizens can use lethal force to protect themselves against perceived threats.
Advocates believed that the new law would ultimately reduce crime; opponents feared an increase in the use of lethal force.

## Recap of AE {.smaller}

-   Not all visualizations are equally informative. But, perhaps more importantly, some might be misleading.
-   Always be cautious of a visualization, particularly one with an agenda, at the first glance. Look closely to check if it might be put together to mislead, instead of clarify.
