# Relationships between variables: association vs causation

## Association

-   Description
-   Is variable 1 related to variable 2?

## Association

## Causation

-   Explanation
-   Does variable 1 lead to variable 2?

## Explanatory and response variables

-   Explanatory variable -\> *might affect* -\> response variable

## Examples

What are the explanatory and response variables?

::: incremental
-   How are *college students' opinions on binge drinking* affected by *the binge drinking behaviors of their friends*?
-   How does the *likelihood of stent placement* vary by *gender identity*?
:::

## Explanatory does not equal explanation

::: incremental
-   We often use social categories like race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, etc as explanatory variables
-   But the *categories* don't cause differences; stigma and discrimination and unequal access to power and resources do
-   Ex: How do rates of high blood pressure vary by race?
-   Differences are caused by rac*ism* (structural and interpersonal), not race
:::

# Types of studies

## Observational studies

::: incremental
-   Researcher doesn't make any changes; just collects data

-   Examples

    -   A survey of peoples' opinions on police reform
    -   Data on the race, age, and gender of people who were hired by a firm
:::

## Experiments

::: incremental
-   Researcher assigns participants into different conditions/treatments
-   Control: Everything except one variable is the same between treatments
-   Randomization: If people are randomly assigned to conditions, then groups in different conditions are similar
-   Differences have to be because of the treatment!
:::

## Experiments

::: incremental
-   Recording how much money people leave in a tip jar depending on whether there's a poster with eyes on it on the wall
-   Measuring opinions about the other political party after reading either a news article a participant agrees with or doesn't agree with
:::

## Why does the distinction matter? Back to association vs causation.

::: incremental
-   Observational studies: associations are easy; causation is hard

    -   Is smoking causing cancer, or do people already prone to cancer just happen to smoke more?
    -   Does social media cause anxiety, or do people with anxiety use social media more?

-   Experiments: If everything is the same except for the treatment, then differences have to be because of the treatment

    -   But is that effect important in real life, where things aren't held to be the same?
    -   Experiments are hard and not always ethical!

# Populations and Samples

## Sampling

+---------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| -   You don't need to eat all the soup to check the seasoning | ![](images/05/soup.png)   |
|                                                               |                           |
| -   But you *do* need to make sure it's stirred up            |                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+

## Target population

::: incremental
-   The group you're interested in
-   Determined by your *research question*
-   How is time spent on social media related to likelihood of being diagnosed with anxiety among American teenagers?
-   How is a country's spending on healthcare related to its average life expectancy?
:::

## Sample

::: incremental
-   Who your data points are actually from
-   Determined by your *data set*
-   A survey of 2500 people recruited on the subreddit r/financialindependence
-   Salary and demographic data for all employees at three engineering firms in the Midwest
:::

## Sampling frame

![](images/05/samplingframe.png)

## Sampling frame

::: incremental
-   Who could have been included in your sample?
-   Determined by the sampling process
-   A survey emailed to all sophomores at Duke
-   A survey posted on r/financialindependence
-   Often this is not clearly stated in publicly available data sets :(
:::

## Random and nonrandom samples

-   Random avoids bias, but it's not always possible
-   Nonrandom "convenience samples" are common

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](images/05/famsize.png)

-   What is the sampling frame?

## Representativeness and generalizability {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Representativeness: How much your sample is like the target population

-   Generalizability (the goal!): The idea that your sample will tell us something about a larger group than just the sample

-   It's easier to argue that your results are generalizable if your data are representative

-   But non-representative samples *can* give generalizable results under the right conditions

    -   Does the relationship you're interested in work differently in your sample than in the population?

## This is a problem if you want to estimate mental health in the population

![](images/05/confounder.png)

## But not if you're interested in the social media/mental health relationship

## Interactions are a problem for studying relationships

## Project proposal

-   Example is posted
-   Instructions are shortened; bad data sets removed
-   By class tomorrow: a first draft (for feedback; graded for completion only)
-   Questions?
