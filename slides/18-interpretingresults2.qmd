## Logistics

-   Four classes left. No class Monday. We're almost there! :)

. . .

-   Finishing up the project:

    -   Project component 3: submit for grading by next Tuesday (June 20)

. . .

```         
-   Final paper 

    -   use (revised!) elements of your proposal, descriptive stats, and results to turn your question into a (concise) paper.
    -   More detailed instructions and example will be posted soon
    -   Due Wednesday June 28 11:59pm
```

. . .

```         
-   Final presentation

    -   Short! ~5-10 minutes
    -   Briefly introduce your question, say a bit about why it's interesting, show your results, and talk about what you conclude from them. 
    -   Most on Monday June 26 (last day of class)
    
```

. . .

```         
    -   **Looking for a few volunteers to go on Thursday June 22 instead!**
    
        -   Benefits: 
        -   More time afterwards to focus on your final paper (finish up the semester early?)
        -   No stress while you watch day 2 
        -   Everyone gets more flexibility on time
        -   What's your favorite kind of donut? :)
```

# So you have a p value...

## What can you do with it?

-   Rejecting/failing to reject hypotheses is useful
-   But it's also statistics-speak, not effective communication

## Problems with p values

-   arbitrary cutoffs
-   file drawer problem
-   doesn't pay attention to whether the effect is important
-   sometimes you reject when you shouldn't (5% of the time)

## Solutions: best analysis practices

-   descriptive statistics! pay attention to effect sizes.
-   repeat things! use different data or different analysis techniques. If you get the same thing twice you're less likely to be wrong.

## Objectivity: no one is objective
-   mesearch is helpful sometimes

## Statistics reflects biases

-   It's not objective
-   We make choices that have implications
-   Treating all members of a group as the same
-   Reference categories
-   How we pick categories--what options are offered. Treating categories as fixed when maybe they shouldn't be.
-   How to combat? Make good choices. If you can't fix it, you can point it out as a limitation

## Media reports: use Joseph's material

## Ethics? 

## Reading for Tuesday

-   There's an article linked on the course calendar. Mess around with the interactive element!
