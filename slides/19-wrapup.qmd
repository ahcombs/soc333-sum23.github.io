## Logistics

-   Presentations: Thursday June 22 and Monday June 26
-   Paper: Draft Monday June 26, final Wednesday June 28

-   Questions on instructions/requirements?

## Exercise Q1: Brainstorming directions for future research

-   Write down an idea for a follow up study for each of these:

1.  Researchers surveyed 1000 British teenagers age 13-17 and found that higher rates of social media use are correlated with increased likelihood of anxiety and depression.
2.  In 1951, Asch showed that social pressure led undergraduate men to conform to incorrect suggestions.
3.  Using a longitudinal survey, researchers found that Americans who obtained a college degree between 1995 and 2000 got higher-paying jobs, on average, than people their age who did not obtain a college degree.

## Revisiting p values

## Exercise Q2: What's a p value?

-   A. A measurement of the size of the effect in a statistical analysis 
-   B. The probability of drawing a sample equal to or more extreme than the one you have, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
-   C. The probability that the null hypothesis is true.
-   D. The probability that the alternative hypothesis is true.

## Exercise Q2: What's a p value?

-   A. A measurement of the size of the effect in a statistical analysis 
-   **B. The probability of drawing a sample equal to or more extreme than the one you have, assuming the null hypothesis is true.**
-   C. The probability that the null hypothesis is true.
-   D. The probability that the alternative hypothesis is true.

## Cutoffs

:::incremental
-   Hypothesis tests (and other statistics): results are either statistically significant or insignificant
-   Cutoffs:

    -   Most common: p = 0.05 (1 in 20 chance)
    -   Sometimes: p = 0.1 (1 in 10), p = 0.01 (1 in 100), p = 0.001 (1 in 1000)
    -   Often multiple are reported: result is significant at the 0.05 level and 0.01 level but not at the 0.001 level
:::

## Cutoffs

:::incremental
-   Why those cutoffs? Why not something else? 

    -   Absolutely no reason; they're just nice round numbers (yikes...)
:::
    
## The "file drawer problem"

:::incremental
-   Results with a p value of 0.04 are much more likely to be published than results with a p value of 0.06.
-   But are those really that different?
:::

## Dependence on sample size

:::incremental
-   We survey 200 people---100 living in North Carolina and 100 living in South Carolina---and ask them how happy they are on a scale of 1 to 10. We find that NC residents are .1 points happier than SC residents (NC mean 8.1, SC mean 8, standard deviation 2 points).

    -   p = .72---statistically insignificant; fail to reject the null

-   What if we instead survey 10000 people and find exactly the same thing?

    -   p = .012---statistically significant!
:::

## Errors

-   When there's a cutoff, there's the possibility of being wrong
-   At p = 0.05, you will incorrectly reject the null (Type 1 error) 1 out of every 20 times

## Exercise Q3: Brainstorming directions for future research

-   Write down an idea for a follow up study for each of these:

1.  Researchers surveyed 1000 British teenagers age 13-17 and found that higher rates of social media use are correlated with increased likelihood of anxiety and depression.
2.  In 1951, Asch showed that social pressure led undergraduate men to conform to incorrect suggestions.

# Revisiting p values

## Exercise Q4: What's a p value?

A. A measurement of the effect size in a statistical analysis B. The probability of drawing a sample equal to or more extreme than the one you have, assuming the null hypothesis is true. C. The probability that the null hypothesis is true. D. The probability that the alternative hypothesis is true.

## Problems with p values

-   arbitrary cutoffs
-   file drawer problem
-   doesn't pay attention to whether the effect is important
-   sometimes you reject when you shouldn't (5% of the time)
-   sometimes you don't reject when you should

## Solutions: best analysis practices

-   descriptive statistics! pay attention to effect sizes.
-   repeat things! use different data or different analysis techniques. If you get the same thing twice you're less likely to be wrong.

## Objectivity: no one is objective

-   mesearch is helpful sometimes

## Statistics reflects biases

-   It's not objective
-   We make choices that have implications
-   Treating all members of a group as the same
-   Reference categories
-   How we pick categories--what options are offered. Treating categories as fixed when maybe they shouldn't be.
-   How to combat? Make good choices. If you can't fix it, you can point it out as a limitation

## Media reports: use Joseph's material

## Ethics?
