## Logistics {.smaller}

-   Project component 2 is graded

    -   Check GitHub issues for written feedback
    -   Grades on Sakai

-   Exercise grades up to date too

-   Project component 3, results: draft by Thursday (June 15), submit for grading next Tuesday (June 20)

    -   Drafts should be complete--meaning you attempted all parts

## Today {.smaller}

-   Hypothesis tests in more specifics

## Recap from last time: Hypothesis test process

::: incremental
-   Start with a null hypothesis (boring result; nothing is happening; no group differences) and an alternative hypothesis (the other possibility)

-   In the world where your null hypothesis is true, would your sample be super weird?

    -   We have statistical tests for this

-   If so, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis

-   If not, we fail to reject the null hypothesis

    -   "Fail" sounds harsh but this is normal and fine! We do analysis to find out if our predictions are true--sometimes they aren't and that's valuable to know.

## How do I know if my sample is weird?

-   Would it fall within the distribution of the samples you would get under the null hypothesis?

## How do I know if my sample is weird?

::: incremental
-   We take advantage of the fact that the expected samples under the null hypothesis are (under most circumstances) normally distributed (bell-shaped)--the Central Limit Theorem guarantees it.
-   There is math that describes the shape of normal distributions
-   Z scores tell us how many standard deviations away from the expected mean our sample is.
:::

## Z scores and percentiles

-   Percentile: What percent of the data is below a particular observation
-   Something that can be calculated with software (like R)

    -   The `pnorm()` function takes a Z score and gives you the corresponding percentile

. . .

```{r}
pnorm(q = 1) # q is the Z score (yes, it's confusing). 
# Nel's Z score is 1 because their SAT score is 1 standard 
# deviation above the mean for all test-takers.
```

-   Conclusion: 84% of SAT-takers score below Nel.

## TODO: Z score and percentile exercise

## Z scores and percentiles

-   68% of observations are within 1 standard deviation of the mean
-   95% are within 2 sds
-   99.7% are within 3 sds
