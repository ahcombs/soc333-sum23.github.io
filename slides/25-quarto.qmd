# Warm up

## Course evaluations {.smaller}

-   Your investment in completing the course and TA evaluation thoughtfully for about 10 minutes today will not only help instructors improve their courses, but their instruction techniques as well.

-   Most of the ratings and responses you provide in your evaluations this semester will be shared with future students.
    The more students that contribute evaluations, the more access every student will have to course evaluation data when making future course enrollment decisions.

-   You can address the evaluation forms through links in email reminders or by logging in to [duke.evaluationkit.com](https://duke.evaluationkit.com/) (for course evaluations).

-   Goal: If we can hit 80% response rate on both evaluations, everyone in the class will get an additional point on their HW average.
