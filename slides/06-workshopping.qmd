## Today

-   Fit between research questions and data
-   Workshop your research questions

## Fit between research questions and data

-   Is the sample generalizable to the target population? 
-   Does it contain the necessary variables to answer the research question?

## This is a problem if you want to estimate mental health in the population

## But not if you're interested in the social media/mental health relationship

## Interactions are a problem for studying relationships

## Research questions and variables

-   EADA data

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
sports <- readRDS("../exampleprep/sports_npeople.rds") |> 
  select(-player_coach_ratio)
```

```{r}
glimpse(sports)
```
## Would these research questions work? What variables would they use?

-   How does the number of assistant coaches assigned to teams vary by university? 
-   How does the number of coaches assigned to basketball teams vary by gender of the team? 
-   How is a team's chances of winning related to the number of coaches it has?

## Workshopping {.smaller}

-   Groups of 3

    -   You have access to each others' github repos
    
-   Read your group members' submissions
-   Answer some questions about their work

    -   Make your feedback a GitHub issue: copy/paste template from project instructions; fill out
    -   10-15 min/person
    -   Goal is improvement--how can they make their work better?
    
-   Talk through your thoughts on each group member's proposal and their choice of question (5-10 minutes each)
