    "text": "This page will introduce you to the course computing workflow. We will set up everything you need in order to start using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub‚Äìfour powerful programs that you will be learning to use to analyze data in this class.\nR is a programming language, like Python, C++, Java, and many others. That means it can be used to do all kinds of things. Its primary strength, however, is data analysis, and it is used by many social scientists, statisticians, data scientists, and others to clean, model, transform, and visualize all kinds of data.\nRStudio is an interface for using R--basically, a nice text editor with bells and whistles that are specific to writing code. There are other ways to write programs in R, but most people use RStudio because it is both powerful and free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n\n\nGit and GitHub are the collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course. They can be used for any kind of file‚Äìnot just R. It is likely you‚Äôll run into them if you ever do any work involving writing code that needs to be made available to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGit is a version control system (like ‚ÄúTrack Changes‚Äù features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like Box but much better).\n\n\nToday, we simply aim to get these four tools set up and talking to one another.\nThe good news: All of this only needs to be done one time‚Äìafter this, you‚Äôre set not just for the rest of this class, but for whenever you use these tools again in future!\nThe bad news: It‚Äôs a tedious and nonintuitive process. If you find it frustrating and/or confusing, it‚Äôs not just you. Stick with it, and ask when you get stuck‚Äìwe will take as much time as necessary to make sure it works for everyone.\n\n\nBy time you go through the steps on this page and in the tech setup repo that it pairs with, you will‚Ä¶\n\nHave a functioning R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub setup\nHave an introduction to our course workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub\nGain practice writing a reproducible report using Quarto\nPractice version control using GitHub"

For now, all you need to know is that the box on the left hand side labeled ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù, where the blue &gt; is, is where you will be copy/pasting and running the code that is given to you in the next sections.\n\n\nStep 2: Install some packages\nYou will need a couple of what are called ‚Äúpackages‚Äù to complete the rest of these steps. Packages are basically bundles of code that people write and release that make it easier to do specific tasks in R.\nCopy and paste the following code into the RStudio console. Then hit enter.\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\ninstall.packages(\"gitcreds\")\n\nYour computer might take a few moments to download and install the required code.

Look at the console (left hand window). You should see another tab right next to the word ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù that says ‚ÄúTerminal.‚Äù Click on this. In the terminal window, paste the following code, then hit enter:\n\nwhich git\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe console sends instructions to R. The terminal, on the other hand, sends instructions to the operating system of your computer. The terminal is often used to install and update things and create/delete/move files on your computer.\n\n\nThis checks if you have git installed. If so, it will show a file path‚Äìon a mac, something like /usr/local/bin/git. Congrats, you‚Äôre good to go! Move to Step 5.\nIf instead you see something like git: command not found , you need to install git. Proceed to Step 4.\n\n\nStep 4: Install Git\nThe process varies somewhat by operating system (mac vs windows vs linux). I recommend following the appropriate instructions here.\n\n\nStep 5: Configure Git\nPaste the following code into the RStudio console (you may have to click back into the console if you are still in the terminal from Step 3), edit it to contain your GitHub username and email address, then hit enter.\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Your_GitHub_username\",\n  user.email = \"your_github_email@example.com\"\n)"

Then the two will be able to communicate with one another.\nEnter the following code in the RStudio console and hit enter:\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nThis will take you to the right page on GitHub.

If you really want to use a data set from elsewhere instead, talk to me.\nNot all openintro data sets will work for this course because not all of them lend themselves to sociological questions (see below for research question requirements). Choose data sets that have something to do with people, that contain real (not simulated, not demo) data, and that contain a bare minimum of 50 observations and two interesting variables. Avoid data sets that are used extensively to demonstrate concepts in the textbook. You may not choose questions that are similar to or the same as those used as book examples.\nI recommend the below data sets, all of which are included in openintro.

Give a brief (~1-2 sentence) justification for why you expect this.\n\nIdentify the data set you would use to answer the research question and provide some information about it. Address the following questions:\n\nWhen and how was it originally collected?\nIs it an observational study or an experiment?\nWho or what was sampled, and how many observations are there?\nWhat variables would you use to answer your question?\nDiscuss the strengths and weaknesses of this data set with respect to your research question and target population. Does the sampling strategy make it a good fit? What are its limitations?\n\nProvide a glimpse of your data\n\nUse the glimpse() function to provide a first look at the data set.\n\n\n\n\nVersion to submit for grading (Tuesday May 30, 11:59pm)\nAfter peer review, incorporate your peers‚Äô feedback into your draft. You should revise your questions if they need it. In addition, add ~1 paragraph of thoughts about which question you should ultimately choose to move forward with. In that paragraph, answer the following questions:\n\nWhich question do you think you should pursue for your final project?\nWhy is this the right choice? Discuss quality of the research question (in terms of being specific, feasible, and sociological) and the ability of the data set to answer the question well.\n\nSubmit one Quarto document containing your revised research questions and this summary paragraph."

Describe the data and variables you will use in analysis. Be clear about what purpose your variables serve and how they are operationalized.

Though you may show descriptive analysis, you should go beyond it‚Äìie, you should use one or more of the hypothesis testing techniques we have discussed in class.\n\n\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question.\n\n\n\n\nThis is where you will discuss your overall finding and describe the key results from your analysis. Present the results of your analysis using figures and/or tables, as appropriate. The goal is not to interpret every single element of an output shown, but instead to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\n\nThe analysis results are clearly assessed and interesting findings from the analysis are described. Interpretations are used to to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing, e.g., the interpretation of every model coefficient.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section you‚Äôll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. In short, describe what your results reveal about the research question, as well as what they do not say. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\n\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the analysis results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\n\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\n\nThe report is neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels.

If you were somehow able to measure the entire target population, would you be likely to see the same pattern? Inferential statistics allow you to answer that question.\nCompleting this component will allow you the chance to receive feedback on your analytic strategy and refine it prior to submitting your full paper."

Very few people work in isolation. We constantly get feedback from colleagues, and learning how to give and receive such feedback in a way that makes projects better is essential for coursework as well as for most jobs.\nWhy Quarto? While there is, of course, a learning curve associated with writing analyses in a new way (ie, in Quarto instead of text editors you are more used to, like Word and Google Docs), it is a skill worth learning for statistical analysis in particular. Why? Quarto allows you to easily make your work entirely reproducible. You will be able to give a collaborator one single document that shows all steps in the analysis process as well as all necessary background information and explanation. This makes your work easy for others to understand, check, and modify. Using Quarto also encourages you to learn good coding practices, right from the beginning. You will be explaining what you do as you go along, and the way files are compiled will encourage you to write code that runs correctly in order‚Äìwhich may not sound like much, but it‚Äôs actually quite easy to get disorganized when coding in other ways. We will go over Quarto in class so that you have all the information and support you need to learn it."

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke‚Äôs Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don‚Äôt hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. Please update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity‚Äôs website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: soc333-sum23.github.io/.\nAnnouncements will be emailed through Sakai Announcements periodically. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.\n\n\nWhere to get help\nIf you have a question during class, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone. I will also be available before and after each class session as well as by email.\nCheck out the course support tab for more resources.\n\n\nEmail\nIf you have a question you do not want to bring up in class, you are welcome to email me directly.

These will be graded for completion‚Äìi.e., you will get full points if you show that you made a good-faith attempt to answer all parts. You will receive full points for the in-class exercise portion of the final grade if you submit at least 80% of the exercises on time.\n\n\nHomework\nYou will complete 1-2 homework assignments during the course of the summer term. In homework, you will apply what you‚Äôve learned during lecture to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you‚Äôve learned throughout the semester to analyze a sociological research question of your choice. You will complete the project in several component parts that will be graded individually, and will assemble the parts into a complete paper and presentation at the end of the semester. You will bring a draft of most components to class to workshop with your classmates before submitting them for grading. Your grade will be determined by both the quality of your submitted work and your participation in the peer feedback process. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community‚Äôs safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nInclement weather: In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.¬† Asynchronous catch-up methods may apply.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time.

It is my response variable. It is a discrete numeric variable.\nteamgender: This records the gender of the players on the team. It is an explanatory variable and it is nominal categorical.\nsport: I will use this variable to limit my data frame to the sports that have both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams. It is a nominal categorical variable.\n\n\nPart 2: Univariate distributions\n\nFor each of your variables:\n\nLook at its distribution using the summary() or table() function (as appropriate to its type).\nIndicate how many missing values (NAs) there are.\nIn ~2-3 sentences, describe what you see in the results. Note anything that surprises you.\n\n\nncoaches:\nThe minimum number of coaches per team is one, the median is four, and the maximum is 14. There are no missing values. The fourth quartile is much wider than the other three (spanning from 4-14), and the mean (3.9) is larger than the median, suggesting that the data may be skewed to the right. In other words, there may be a small number of teams with a large number of coaches relative to the rest.\nThe median and the cutoff point for the third quartile are the same (both equal 4), indicating that four is a really common number of coaches for teams to have.\n\nsummary(sports$ncoaches)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Explain why or why not. If not, which will you include and which will you exclude?\nI will not analyze all of the observations in my data set because analyzing all of them would make for an unfair comparison. There is a different set of sports available for men than for women. I am interested in comparing the number of coaches for comparable men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams, so I will exclude sports for which there are only men‚Äôs teams or only women‚Äôs teams (e.g., football, softball).\nDo you need to create any new variables? Explain why or why not. If so, what are they?\nI do not need to create any new variables. My explanatory variable is teamgender and my response variable is ncoaches, and they already fit my research question well in their current forms.\nIf necessary, use the code chunk below to make any needed changes (filtering observations and creating variables) to your data.\n\n\n# first, I need to figure out which sports have teams for both genders\ntable(sports$sport, sports$teamgender)\n\n                           \n                            men women\n  All Track Combined         36    36\n  Baseball                   38     0\n  Basketball                 38    38\n  Fencing                    38    38\n  Field Hockey                0    38\n  Football                   38     0\n  Golf                       38    38\n  Gymnastics                  0    19\n  Lacrosse                   38    38\n  Rowing                      0    38\n  Soccer                     38    38\n  Softball                    0    24\n  Swimming and Diving        38    38\n  Tennis                     38    38\n  Track and Field X Country   2     2\n  Volleyball                  0    38\n  Wrestling                  38     0\n\n# from that table, I can see that I need to remove baseball, field hockey, football, gymnastics, rowing, softball, volleyball, and wrestling.\nsports_filtered &lt;- sports |&gt; \n  filter(\n    sport != \"Baseball\",\n    sport != \"Field Hockey\",\n    sport != \"Football\",\n    sport != \"Gymnastics\",\n    sport != \"Rowing\",\n    sport != \"Softball\",\n    sport != \"Volleyball\",\n    sport != \"Wrestling\"\n  )\n\n# did it work? Let's make the same table with the new data set\ntable(sports_filtered$sport, sports_filtered$teamgender)\n\n                           \n                            men women\n  All Track Combined         36    36\n  Basketball                 38    38\n  Fencing                    38    38\n  Golf                       38    38\n  Lacrosse                   38    38\n  Soccer                     38    38\n  Swimming and Diving        38    38\n  Tennis                     38    38\n  Track and Field X Country   2     2\n\n# now all the sports have both men's and women's teams--we're good to go!\n\n\n\nPart 4: Multivariate visualizations\n\nMake a plot showing the relationship between your explanatory (independent) and response (dependent) variables. Depending on your variable types, this might be a scatter plot, box plot, bar chart, etc. Include meaningful axis labels.\nInterpret your plot in a few sentences. Does it appear these variables are associated with one another? Does anything about the relationship surprise you? Is it consistent or inconsistent with your hypothesis?\nAs suggested by the univariate summary statistics, the distribution of the number of coaches is skewed to the right. The distributions look nearly identical for men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams, so it appears that team gender and staffing levels are probably not associated with one another. This is consistent with my hypothesis and is not very surprising, though I was not expecting the distributions to be as extraordinarily similar as they appear here.\n\n\n# I have one numeric and one categorical variable, so a boxplot (as in example code in the assignment template) would also be a good choice here--but for variety I will show the same information in histogram form\nggplot(data = sports_filtered, aes(x = ncoaches, fill = teamgender)) + \n  geom_histogram(\n    position = position_dodge(), # this puts the bars next to each other\n    binwidth = 1\n    ) + \n  labs(x = \"Number of coaches\",\n       y = \"Number of teams\",\n       title = \"Distribution of staffing levels by team gender for Duke and UNC sports\",\n       fill = \"Team gender\")"

I expect this because jobs in service-related industries are more likely to depend on in-person interactions with customers that were particularly affected by the pandemic.\nData set: I plan to use the reddit_finance data set from the openintro package to answer this question. These data are from a survey that was distributed to users of the subreddit r/financialindependence in 2020. It is an observational study. 1998 Reddit users were sampled.\nVariables: To answer this question, I would use the variables ‚Äúpan_inc_chg‚Äù, which measures whether someone‚Äôs income increased, decreased, or stayed the same as a result of the pandemic, and ‚Äúindustry‚Äù, which measures the industry that the respondent was employed in.\nStrengths and weaknesses: The strengths of this data set are that it contains detailed measures of both pandemic-related income change and employment sector. It has two main weaknesses. First, it uses a convenience sample of Reddit users active in the r/financialindependence subreddit. This group is likely much more interested in and perhaps more knowledgeable about finances than people who do not choose to spend time in this subreddit, and so their financial trajectories post-pandemic were likely different than for others. This impairs the generalizability of results. Second, the ‚Äúpan_inc_chg‚Äù variable is a self-reported estimate, not an exact value. People may have misremembered or misjudged their income change. This impairs the accuracy of the analysis.\n\nglimpse(reddit_finance)\n\nRows: 1,998\nColumns: 65\n$ num_incomes             &lt;chr&gt; \"1\", \"2\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"2\", \"2\", \"‚Ä¶\n$ pan_inc_chg             &lt;chr&gt;

I expect this because universities are required to adhere to Title IX, which would prohibit differential levels of resources for equivalent sports.\nData: These data were reported by Duke and UNC annually from 2003-2021. It is an observational study. All coaches from both institutions are represented in the data set. It contains 2311 observations (team-years).\nVariables: I will use the teamgender, sport, and ncoaches variables to answer this question.\nStrengths and weaknesses: A strength of this data set is that it is administrative data, and so represents all coaches that were employed by these institutions. A weakness is that only two institutions are represented, and both are highly selective institutions with strong athletics programs. This limits the generalizability of the results to institutions that are less selective and that have less resourced athletics programs.\n\nsports &lt;- readRDS(\"sports_teams.rds\") # This data set is not part of openintro, so this line is needed to load it from a file instead.\n\nglimpse(sports)\n\nRows: 879\nColumns: 8\n$ school             &lt;chr&gt; \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Duke\", \"Du‚Ä¶\n$ year               &lt;dbl&gt; 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 2003, 200‚Ä¶\n$ division           &lt;chr&gt; \"NCAA Division I-A\", \"NCAA Division I-A\", \"NCAA Div‚Ä¶\n$ teamgender         &lt;chr&gt; \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"men\", \"m‚Ä¶\n$ sport              &lt;chr&gt; \"Baseball\", \"Basketball\", \"Fencing\", \"Football\", \"G‚Ä¶\n$ ncoaches           &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 4, 1, 10, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 6, 13, 2‚Ä¶\n$ nplayers           &lt;dbl&gt; 33, 15, 19, 81, 12, 45, 23, 32, 11, 50, 35, 35, 30,‚Ä¶\n$ player_coach_ratio &lt;dbl&gt; 11.000000, 3.750000, 19.000000, 8.100000, 6.000000,‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I should pursue research question 2, on the level of staffing of college sports teams by team gender. Although I believe both research questions are sufficiently specific, feasible, and sociological, I think the data set I would use to answer question 2 is a better fit for the question than the data set I would use to answer question 1. The fact that my data set for question 1 is a convenience sample of users of one particular subreddit dramatically reduces the ability of any analysis to generalize to a broad population. The data set that I would use for question 2 is also limited by its sample‚Äîit contains coaches at just two universities. However, it contains every coach that worked at each of those institutions, and those institutions are representative of a broader group of universities that would be interesting to generalize to (selective universities with strong athletics programs)."

    "text": "Research question: How was income change as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic associated with the industry in which a person was employed?\nTarget population: Non-retired adults who were employed before the pandemic hit.\nHypothesis: I hypothesize that people employed in service-related industries will see greater income drops than people in other industries. I expect this because jobs in service-related industries are more likely to depend on in-person interactions with customers that were particularly affected by the pandemic.\nData set: I plan to use the reddit_finance data set from the openintro package to answer this question. These data are from a survey that was distributed to users of the subreddit r/financialindependence in 2020. It is an observational study. 1998 Reddit users were sampled.\nVariables: To answer this question, I would use the variables ‚Äúpan_inc_chg‚Äù, which measures whether someone‚Äôs income increased, decreased, or stayed the same as a result of the pandemic, and ‚Äúindustry‚Äù, which measures the industry that the respondent was employed in.\nStrengths and weaknesses: The strengths of this data set are that it contains detailed measures of both pandemic-related income change and employment sector. It has two main weaknesses. First, it uses a convenience sample of Reddit users active in the r/financialindependence subreddit. This group is likely much more interested in and perhaps more knowledgeable about finances than people who do not choose to spend time in this subreddit, and so their financial trajectories post-pandemic were likely different than for others. This impairs the generalizability of results. Second, the ‚Äúpan_inc_chg‚Äù variable is a self-reported estimate, not an exact value. People may have misremembered or misjudged their income change. This impairs the accuracy of the analysis.\n\nglimpse(reddit_finance)\n\nRows: 1,998\nColumns: 65\n$ num_incomes             &lt;chr&gt; \"1\", \"2\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"2\", \"2\", \"‚Ä¶\n$ pan_inc_chg             &lt;chr&gt;

I expect this because universities are required to adhere to Title IX, which would prohibit differential levels of resources for equivalent sports.\nData: These data were reported by Duke and UNC annually from 2003-2021. It is an observational study. All coaches from both institutions are represented in the data set.

Although I believe both research questions are sufficiently specific, feasible, and sociological, I think the data set I would use to answer question 2 is a better fit for the question than the data set I would use to answer question 1. The fact that my data set for question 1 is a convenience sample of users of one particular subreddit dramatically reduces the ability of any analysis to generalize to a broad population. The data set that I would use for question 2 is also limited by its sample‚Äîit contains coaches at just two universities. However, it contains every coach that worked at each of those institutions, and those institutions are representative of a broader group of universities that would be interesting to generalize to (selective universities with strong athletics programs)."
