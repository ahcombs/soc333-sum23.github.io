    "text": "This page will introduce you to the course computing workflow. We will set up everything you need in order to start using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub‚Äìfour powerful programs that you will be learning to use to analyze data in this class.\nR is a programming language, like Python, C++, Java, and many others. That means it can be used to do all kinds of things. Its primary strength, however, is data analysis, and it is used by many social scientists, statisticians, data scientists, and others to clean, model, transform, and visualize all kinds of data.\nRStudio is an interface for using R--basically, a nice text editor with bells and whistles that are specific to writing code. There are other ways to write programs in R, but most people use RStudio because it is both powerful and free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n\n\nGit and GitHub are the collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course. They can be used for any kind of file‚Äìnot just R. It is likely you‚Äôll run into them if you ever do any work involving writing code that needs to be made available to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGit is a version control system (like ‚ÄúTrack Changes‚Äù features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like Box but much better).\n\n\nToday, we simply aim to get these four tools set up and talking to one another. This can be a little tedious, but I ask that you stick with it‚Äìit only needs to be done once, and we will take as much time as we need to ensure it works for everyone.\nGoals: By time you go through the steps on this page and in the tech-setup repo that it pairs with, you will‚Ä¶\n\nHave a functioning R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub setup\nHave an introduction to our course workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub\nGain practice writing a reproducible report using Quarto\nPractice version control using GitHub"

For now, all you need to know is that the box on the left hand side labeled ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù, where the blue ‚Äú&gt;‚Äù is, is where you will be copy/pasting and running the code that is given to you in the next sections.\n\nStep 2: Install some packages\nYou will need a couple of what are called ‚Äúpackages‚Äù to complete the rest of these steps. Packages are basically bundles of code that people write and release that make it easier to do specific tasks in R.\nCopy and paste the following code into the RStudio console. Then hit enter.\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\ninstall.packages(\"gitcreds\")\n\nYour computer might take a few moments to download and install the required code.

This page contains the same instructions in text form, with copy-pastable code.\n\nStep 3. Do you already have Git?\nOpen RStudio. Look at the console (left hand window). You should see another tab right next to the word ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù that says ‚ÄúTerminal.‚Äù Click on this. In this window, paste the following code, then hit enter:\n\nwhich git\n\nThis checks if you have git installed. If so, it will show a file path‚Äìsomething like /usr/local/bin/git. Congrats, you‚Äôre good to go! Move to Step 5.\nIf instead you see something like git: command not found , you need to install git. Proceed to Step 3.\n\n\nStep 4: Install Git\nThe process varies somewhat by operating system (mac vs windows vs linux). I recommend following the appropriate instructions here.\n\n\nStep 5: Configure Git\nPaste the following code into the RStudio console (you may have to click back into the console if you are still in the terminal from Step 3), then hit enter.\n\nusethis::edit_git_config()\n\nThis will open a file with some information in it. After name = , write your name in quotation marks, eg name = \"Aidan Combs\" . Then provide your email where it says email =, also in quotation marks.

Using the feedback provided by your classmates, you will choose one to pursue further.\n\n\nYou will need to find two data sets: one for each of your research questions. You may write additional research questions on a single data set if you would like additional feedback, but in all cases, you must consider and present at least two data sets in total. In other words, additional questions on a single data set are extra; they do not count towards your required two questions.\nI highly recommend selecting data sets included with the openintro package. There is all kinds of interesting data freely available on the internet, but it is a good idea to stick with openintro because their data sets are clean and easy to work with. We already have a lot to do in just 6 weeks, and so will not be covering how to prepare ‚Äúmessy‚Äù data for analysis (I recommend a data science course like STA 199 for this!). If you really, really want to use a data set from elsewhere, talk to me.\nNot all openintro data sets will work for this course because not all of them lend themselves to sociological questions (see below for research question requirements‚Äìthey must have to do with people living in a social system). Choose data sets that have something to do with people, that contain real (not simulated, not demo) data, and that contain a bare minimum of 50 cases and two interesting variables. Avoid data sets that are used extensively to demonstrate concepts in the textbook. You may not choose questions that are similar to or the same as those used as book examples.\nThe below data sets are good places to start, though you may propose others so long as they allow you to write a research question about people and the social systems they live in.\n-   acs12\n-   cia_factbook\n-   county_2019\n-   county_complete\n-   dds.discr\n-   evals\n-   fatal_police_shootings\n-   gpa\n-   gss2010\n-   hfi\n-   hsb2\n-   labor_market_discrimination\n-   military\n-   mn_police_use_of_force\n-   ncbirths\n-   piracy\n-   satgpa\n-   sowc_demographics\n-   voter_count\n-   yrbss\n\n\n\nYou are required to propose a minimum of 2 research questions, to be answered with 2 separate data sets, that you‚Äôre interested in potentially using for the final project. If you would like to receive feedback on more than two research questions, you may optionally submit additional questions. You will review each others‚Äô proposals in groups of 2-3. After peer review, you will be responsible for updating your draft and submitting for grading according to the requirements below.\nFor each research question, you should:\n\nClearly state the specific research question.

Give a brief (~1-2 sentence) justification for why you expect this.\n\nIdentify the data set you would use to answer the research question and provide some information about it. Address the following questions:\n\nWhen and how was it originally collected?\nIs it an observational study or an experiment?\nWho or what was sampled, and how many cases are there?\nWhat variables would you use to answer your question?\nWhy is this data set a good fit for your research question?\nBriefly (in ~2-3 sentences) address any ethical concerns. If none, explain why there are none.\n\nProvide a glimpse of your data\n\nPlace the file containing your data in the data folder of the project repo.\nUse the glimpse() function to provide a glimpse of the data set.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter peer review, incorporate your peers‚Äô feedback into your draft. In addition, add ~1 paragraph of thoughts about which question you should ultimately choose to move forward with. In that paragraph, answer the following questions:\n\nWhich question do you think you should pursue for your final project?\nWhy is this the right choice?

I intend that you are able to pull in much of this information from the previous three components of this project (the proposal, descriptive statistics, and results). However, you must edit to ensure that the report reads well as a cohesive whole, and you must also address any relevant feedback you received on those components. You must not simply paste your three previous assignments together in one document; this will not score well.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up.

Before you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is off with the option echo: false in the YAML.\nThe complete paper, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long.

The research question is well formulated and the data set fits the question. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report.\n\n\n\n\nThis section includes a brief description of your data and your analysis process. Describe the data and variables you will use in analysis. Be clear about what purpose your variables serve and how they are operationalized. Explain your analysis strategy and why this strategy is appropriate for your question and variables. Though you may show descriptive analysis, you should go beyond it‚Äìie, you should use one or more of the hypothesis testing techniques we have discussed in class.\n\n\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question.\n\n\n\n\nThis is where you will discuss your overall finding and describe the key results from your analysis.

I can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don‚Äôt anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!\nIf the status shows Operational, this means the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection, if need be, restart your computer to ensure a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, email me with details on what you‚Äôve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots).\n\nAnother approach is to request a restart of your container.

Describe the results. Does anything about them surprise you?\nNote how many missing values there are. Hint: use the useNA = \"always\" option if using table(). Does this seem reasonable?\nMake a histogram of the variable‚Äôs distribution.\nDescribe the distribution. Does anything surprise you? For continuous and ordinal variables, tell me which distribution terms discussed in class apply. I.e., is the variable‚Äôs distribution normal? Unimodal? Skewed? Uniform?\n\nMake a plot showing the relationship between your primary independent and dependent variables. Depending on your variable types, this could be a scatter plot, box plot, bar chart, etc.\n\nInterpret your plot in ~2-3 sentences. Does it appear these variables are associated with one another? Does anything about the relationship surprise you? Is it consistent or inconsistent with your hypothesis?"

This will help you head off problems later. For example, looking at the distributions of your variables will reveal if data is missing when you don‚Äôt expect it to be. It also might clue you in on interesting patterns you may want to investigate further. Looking at bivariate associations between variables gives you a sense of what the relationship between them looks like, which will help you interpret inferential statistics."

Very few people work in isolation. We constantly get feedback from colleagues, and learning how to give and receive such feedback in a way that makes projects better is essential for coursework as well as for most jobs.\nWhy Quarto? While there is, of course, a learning curve associated with writing analyses in a new way (ie, in Quarto instead of text editors you are more used to, like Word and Google Docs), it is a skill worth learning for statistical analysis in particular. Why? Quarto allows you to easily make your work entirely reproducible. You will be able to give a collaborator one single document that shows all steps in the analysis process as well as all necessary background information and explanation. This makes your work easy for others to understand, check, and modify. Using Quarto also encourages you to learn good coding practices, right from the beginning. You will be explaining what you do as you go along, and the way files are compiled will encourage you to write code that runs correctly in order‚Äìwhich may not sound like much, but it‚Äôs actually quite easy to get disorganized when coding in other ways. We will go over Quarto in class so that you have all the information and support you need to learn it."

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke‚Äôs Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don‚Äôt hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. Please update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity‚Äôs website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: soc333-sum23.github.io/.\nAnnouncements will be emailed through Sakai Announcements periodically. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.\n\n\nWhere to get help\nIf you have a question during class, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone. I will also be available before and after each class session as well as by email.\nCheck out the course support tab for more resources.\n\n\nEmail\nIf you have a question you do not want to bring up in class, you are welcome to email me directly. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. I will respond more slowly to emails sent Friday evening - Sunday."

    "section": "Assessments",
    "text": "Assessments\nThe assessments in this course are designed to help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives.\n\nIn-class exercises\nWe will spend a significant portion of our class time learning to apply concepts from lectures by doing in-class exercises. You will be expected to turn in the exercises from lecture before the next class period. For example, you will be expected to submit the Tuesday exercises before class starts on Wednesday. These will be graded for completion‚Äìi.e., you will get full points if you show that you made a good-faith attempt to answer all parts. You will receive full points for the in-class exercise portion of the final grade if you submit at least 80% of the exercises on time.\n\n\nHomework\nYou will complete 1-2 homework assignments during the course of the summer term. In homework, you will apply what you‚Äôve learned during lecture to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you‚Äôve learned throughout the semester to analyze a sociological research question of your choice. You will complete the project in several component parts that will be graded individually, and will assemble the parts into a complete paper and presentation at the end of the semester. You will bring a draft of most components to class to workshop with your classmates before submitting them for grading. Your grade will be determined by both the quality of your submitted work and your participation in the peer feedback process. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don‚Äôt cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: You may discuss individual homework assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g.¬†StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\nLate work\n\nHomework, project components, and in-class exercises may be submitted up to 3 days late. Details on the associated penalties will be provided with the assignment information.\n\n\n\nExtenuating circumstances\nThings happen that make it impossible to submit every assignment on time. The grading schemes for each assignment build in some flexibility to ensure you are not penalized for occasional missed classes or deadlines.\nIn the case that you must miss class, please let me know. My slides will be made accessible to all students. You will still be expected to complete that day‚Äôs in-class exercises, but you will have to do so on your own.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please talk to me and/or let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource.\nNote: If you‚Äôve read this far in the syllabus, email me a picture of your pet if you have one or your favorite meme!\n\n\nAttendance policy\n\nCOVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection: Student health, safety, and well-being are the university‚Äôs top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community‚Äôs safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nInclement weather: In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.¬† Asynchronous catch-up methods may apply.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays."
