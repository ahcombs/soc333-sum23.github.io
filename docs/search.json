We will do it this way because often, things make more sense if you can see right away how they are used to solve a problem.\nOnce you are set up on GitHub, you will access these files in RStudio, rather than through the course webpage (as you are probably doing now). That means you will be able to (and will be required to) edit the files directly to answer the questions they provide. You will have to edit these files in a few specified places (you may also edit them further to try things out or to take notes, if you wish‚ÄìI will only grade the edits I ask for).\nProblems or questions that I expect you to address will be wrapped in a note (example below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is a note. Notes will contain exercises and questions you need to provide an answer to.\n\n\nFor this exercise, you will submit your response via the assignments tab in Sakai. After this, you will instead submit exercises by pushing your edits to GitHub. More details to follow in future.\nYou will have to complete an exercise most days that we have class. I expect you should be able to complete most of it in class. You should submit it before the start of the next class period. I will grade them for completion. If you are absent from class, you are still required to complete the day‚Äôs exercise, but will have to do so on your own."

    "text": "Data visualization and summary\n\nPlot y vs.¬†x for the dino dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset.\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your document and successfully render it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\n# dino_data &lt;- datasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n#   filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let‚Äôs slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |&gt;, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we‚Äôre saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: &lt;-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you‚Äôre visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g.¬†the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points, hence geom_point.\n\n# ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n#   geom_point()\n\nFor the second part of this exercise, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn‚Äôt make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear (it‚Äôs dinosaurial)!\nFor illustrative purposes only, let‚Äôs calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStart with `dino_data` and calculate a summary statistic that we will call `r` as the `cor`relation between `x` and `y`.\n\n\n\n# dino_data |&gt;\n#   summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n\nThis is a good place to pause, render, and commit changes with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Ex 2.‚Äù\nThen, push these changes when you‚Äôre done.\n\n\nPlot y vs.¬†x for the circle dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\n\n\nThis is another good place to pause, render, and commit changes with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Ex 3.‚Äù\nThen, push these changes when you‚Äôre done.\n\n\nPlot y vs.¬†x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\n\n\nYou should pause again, render, commit changes with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Ex 4‚Äù.\nThen, push.\n\nFinally, let‚Äôs plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of faceting, given by the code below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFacet by the dataset variable, placing the plots in a 3 column grid, and don‚Äôt add a legend.\n\n\n\n# ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset))+\n#   geom_point()+\n#   facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n#   theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nAnd we can use the group_by function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients. We‚Äôll go through these functions next week when we learn about data wrangling.\n\n# datasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n#   group_by(dataset) |&gt;\n#   summarize(r = cor(x, y)) \n\n\nInclude the faceted plot and the summary of the correlation coefficients in your lab write-up by including relevant code in R chunks (and give them appropriate labels). In the narrative below the code chunks, briefly comment on what you notice about the plots and the correlations between x and y values within each of them (one or two sentences is fine!).\n\nYou‚Äôre done with the data analysis exercises, but we‚Äôd like to do one more thing to customize the look of the report."

You may write additional research questions on a single data set if you would like additional feedback, but in all cases, you must consider and present at least two data sets in total. In other words, additional questions on a single data set are extra; they do not count towards your required two questions.\nI highly recommend selecting data sets included with the openintro package. There is all kinds of interesting data freely available on the internet, but it is a good idea to stick with openintro because their data sets are clean and easy to work with. We already have a lot to do in just 6 weeks, and so will not be covering how to prepare ‚Äúmessy‚Äù data for analysis (I recommend a data science course like STA 199 for this!). If you really, really want to use a data set from elsewhere, talk to me.\nNot all openintro data sets will work for this course because not all of them lend themselves to sociological questions (see below for research question requirements‚Äìthey must have to do with people living in a social system). Choose data sets that have something to do with people, that contain real (not simulated, not demo) data, and that contain a bare minimum of 50 cases and two interesting variables. Avoid data sets that are used extensively to demonstrate concepts in the textbook.

If you would like to receive feedback on more than two research questions, you may optionally submit additional questions. You will review each others‚Äô proposals in groups of 2-3. After peer review, you will be responsible for updating your draft and submitting for grading according to the requirements below.\nFor each research question, you should:\n\nClearly state the specific research question. Make sure it fulfills the following requirements:\n\nMust be specific and well-formulated (see slides LINK)\nMust involve a relationship between at least two variables\nMust be sociological in some way‚Äìthis is a sociology class, after all. In other words, it has to have something to do with people living in a social system. If you are not sure whether your question meets this requirement, ask!\n\nAdditionally, provide some supporting information:\n\nWhat is your target population?\nWrite ~1 paragraph giving any necessary background information and explaining why the question is interesting to study.\nWrite down a hypothesis stating what you expect to find. Give a brief (~1-2 sentence) justification for why you expect this.\n\nIdentify the data set you would use to answer the research question and provide some information about it. Address the following questions:\n\nWhen and how was it originally collected?\nIs it an observational study or an experiment?\nWho or what was sampled, and how many cases are there?\nWhat variables would you use to answer your question?\nWhy is this data set a good fit for your research question?\nBriefly (in ~2-3 sentences) address any ethical concerns. If none, explain why there are none.\n\nProvide a glimpse of your data\n\nPlace the file containing your data in the data folder of the project repo.\nUse the glimpse() function to provide a glimpse of the data set.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter peer review, incorporate your peers‚Äô feedback into your draft. In addition, add ~1 paragraph of thoughts about which question you should ultimately choose to move forward with. In that paragraph, answer the following questions:\n\nWhich question do you think you should pursue for your final project?\nWhy is this the right choice? Discuss fit between the research question and data set, feasibility, and value of the research question.\n\nSubmit one Quarto document containing your revised research questions and this summary paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer feedback: draft completion; quality of feedback given; peer feedback incorporated into final submission\n30%\n\n\nResearch questions\n20%\n\n\nData set descriptions\n20%\n\n\nData set glimpses\n10%\n\n\nParagraph on research question choice\n10%\n\n\nWorkflow and formatting\n10%\n\n\n\nEach component will be graded as follows:\n\nMeets expectations (full credit): All required elements are completed and are accurate. The narrative is written clearly, all tables and visualizations are nicely formatted, and the work would be presentable in a professional setting.\nClose to expectations (half credit): There are some elements missing and/or inaccurate. There are some issues with formatting.\nDoes not meet expectations (no credit): Major elements missing. Work is not neatly formatted and would not be presentable in a professional setting.\n\nIt is critical to check feedback on your project proposal. Even if you earn full credit, it may not mean that your proposal is perfect. Just like you are expected to incorporate feedback from your peers into your graded proposal, you will be expected to incorporate feedback from me into the relevant sections of your final paper. The degree to which you address feedback will be a component of your final paper grade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nThere are three main purposes of the project proposal:\n\nTo get you thinking about the project early so you can get a head start on refining your question, finding your data, and doing your analysis.\nTo ensure that the data you wish to analyze, methods you plan to use, and the scope of your analysis are feasible and will allow you to be successful.\nTo give you practice talking about analysis ideas and plans with your peers."

You may not choose questions that are similar to or the same as those used as book examples.\nThe below data sets are good places to start, though you may propose others so long as they allow you to write a research question about people and the social systems they live in.\n-   acs12\n-   cia_factbook\n-   county_2019\n-   county_complete\n-   dds.discr\n-   evals\n-   fatal_police_shootings\n-   gpa\n-   gss2010\n-   hfi\n-   hsb2\n-   labor_market_discrimination\n-   military\n-   mn_police_use_of_force\n-   ncbirths\n-   piracy\n-   satgpa\n-   sowc_demographics\n-   voter_count\n-   yrbss\n\n\n\nYou are required to propose a minimum of 2 research questions, to be answered with 2 separate data sets, that you‚Äôre interested in potentially using for the final project. If you would like to receive feedback on more than two research questions, you may optionally submit additional questions. You will review each others‚Äô proposals in groups of 2-3. After peer review, you will be responsible for updating your draft and submitting for grading according to the requirements below.\nFor each research question, you should:\n\nClearly state the specific research question. Make sure it fulfills the following requirements:\n\nMust be specific and well-formulated (see slides LINK)\nMust involve a relationship between at least two variables\nMust be sociological in some way‚Äìthis is a sociology class, after all. In other words, it has to have something to do with people living in a social system. If you are not sure whether your question meets this requirement, ask!\n\nAdditionally, provide some supporting information:\n\nWhat is your target population?\nWrite ~1 paragraph giving any necessary background information and explaining why the question is interesting to study.\nWrite down a hypothesis stating what you expect to find. Give a brief (~1-2 sentence) justification for why you expect this.\n\nIdentify the data set you would use to answer the research question and provide some information about it. Address the following questions:\n\nWhen and how was it originally collected?\nIs it an observational study or an experiment?\nWho or what was sampled, and how many cases are there?\nWhat variables would you use to answer your question?\nWhy is this data set a good fit for your research question?\nBriefly (in ~2-3 sentences) address any ethical concerns. If none, explain why there are none.\n\nProvide a glimpse of your data\n\nPlace the file containing your data in the data folder of the project repo.\nUse the glimpse() function to provide a glimpse of the data set.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter peer review, incorporate your peers‚Äô feedback into your draft. In addition, add ~1 paragraph of thoughts about which question you should ultimately choose to move forward with. In that paragraph, answer the following questions:\n\nWhich question do you think you should pursue for your final project?\nWhy is this the right choice? Discuss fit between the research question and data set, feasibility, and value of the research question.\n\nSubmit one Quarto document containing your revised research questions and this summary paragraph."

Looking at bivariate associations between variables gives you a sense of what the relationship between them looks like, which will help you interpret inferential statistics."

We will do it this way because often, things make more sense if you can see right away how they are used to solve a problem.\nOnce you are set up on GitHub, you will access these files in RStudio, rather than through the course webpage (as you are probably doing now). That means you will be able to (and will be required to) edit the files directly to answer the questions they provide. You will have to edit these files in a few specified places (you may also edit them further to try things out or to take notes, if you wish‚ÄìI will only grade the edits I ask for).\nProblems or questions that I expect you to address will be wrapped in a note (example below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is a note. Notes will contain problems and questions you need to provide an answer to.\n\n\nFor this exercise, you will submit your response via the assignments tab in Sakai. After this, you will instead submit exercises by pushing your edits to GitHub. More details to follow in future.\nYou will have to complete an exercise most days that we have class. I expect you should be able to complete most of it in class. You should submit it before the start of the next class period. I will grade them for completion. If you are absent from class, you are still required to complete the day‚Äôs exercise, but will have to do so on your own."

Very few people work in isolation. We constantly get feedback from colleagues, and learning how to give and receive such feedback in a way that makes projects better is essential for coursework as well as for most jobs.\nWhy Quarto? While there is, of course, a learning curve associated with writing analyses in a new way (ie, in Quarto instead of text editors you are more used to, like Word and Google Docs), it is a skill worth learning for statistical analysis in particular. Why? Quarto allows you to easily make your work entirely reproducible. You will be able to give a collaborator one single document that shows all steps in the analysis process as well as all necessary background information and explanation. This makes your work easy for others to understand, check, and modify. Using Quarto also encourages you to learn good coding practices, right from the beginning. You will be explaining what you do as you go along, and the way files are compiled will encourage you to write code that runs correctly in order‚Äìwhich may not sound like much, but it‚Äôs actually quite easy to get disorganized when coding in other ways. We will go over Quarto in class so that you have all the information and support you need to learn it."

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke‚Äôs Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don‚Äôt hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. Please update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity‚Äôs website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: soc333-sum23.github.io/.\nAnnouncements will be emailed through Sakai Announcements periodically. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.\n\n\nWhere to get help\nIf you have a question during class, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

These will be graded for completion‚Äìi.e., you will get full points if you show that you made a good-faith attempt to answer all parts. You will receive full points for the in-class exercise portion of the final grade if you submit at least 80% of the exercises on time.\n\n\nHomework\nYou will complete 1-2 homework assignments during the course of the summer term. In homework, you will apply what you‚Äôve learned during lecture to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you‚Äôve learned throughout the semester to analyze a sociological research question of your choice. You will complete the project in several component parts that will be graded individually, and will assemble the parts into a complete paper and presentation at the end of the semester. You will bring a draft of most components to class to workshop with your classmates before submitting them for grading. Your grade will be determined by both the quality of your submitted work and your participation in the peer feedback process. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g.¬†StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\nLate work\n\nHomework, project components, and in-class exercises may be submitted up to 3 days late. Details on the associated penalties will be provided with the assignment information.\n\n\n\nExtenuating circumstances\nThings happen that make it impossible to submit every assignment on time.

To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community‚Äôs safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nInclement weather: In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.¬† Asynchronous catch-up methods may apply.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays."
