How does the amount of money a country spends on healthcare (per person) affect its average life expectancy?\n\n    -   Explanatory variable(s) and type(s)?\n    -   Response variable and type?\n    -   Correct statistical test?\n\n## Q2: Determining the correct hypothesis test, part 2. *See slides from lecture 15 for solutions*\n\nSame thing, new questions. For each, identify the explanatory variable, the response variable, their types, and the correct statistical test.\n\nb. How is a patient's body mass index related to the probability a doctor refers them to a specialist?\n\n    -   Explanatory variable(s) and type(s)?\n    -   Response variable and type?\n    -   Correct statistical test?\n\nc. How do outcomes of traffic stops (which can be warnings, citations, or arrests) vary by the driver's race?\n\n    -   Explanatory variable(s) and type(s)?\n    -   Response variable and type?\n    -   Correct statistical test?\n\n## Q3: Running your first hypothesis test!\n\nWe will be returning to the `acs12` data for this exercise. We will be using two variables: `gender` and `married`.\n\nBoth are categorical variables with two categories (male/female for gender, yes/no for married), so we'll use a two-sample Z test, just like in the class example.\n\nResearch question: How is someone's gender identity related to their probability of being married?\n\nHere's a table to show the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(acs12$gender, acs12$married)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n        \n          no yes\n  male   584 447\n  female 583 386\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the test statistic\n\nThen look at it in the data viewer. What is the Z score of this sample?\n\n**The Z score of this sample is about 1.6**\n\n(You might notice that R gives you a warning message. This is fine in this case! It just means we shouldn't read into the positive/negative sign on the Z score. But since we're doing a two-tailed test here, that didn't matter anyway.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntest_stat <- acs12 |> \n  specify(explanatory = gender,\n          response = married,\n          success = \"yes\") |> \n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") |> \n  calculate(stat = \"z\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: The statistic is based on a difference or ratio; by default, for\ndifference-based statistics, the explanatory variable is subtracted in the\norder \"male\" - \"female\", or divided in the order \"male\" / \"female\" for\nratio-based statistics.

At a threshold value of p = 0.05, do you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis that about the same number of men are married as women?\n\n**I fail to reject the null hypothesis that about the same number of men are married as women. My p value, 0.116, is above my cutoff value of 0.05.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_p_value(null_dist,\n            obs_stat = test_stat,\n            direction = \"two-sided\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  p_value\n    <dbl>\n1   0.132\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Step 4: Visualize where your sample is with respect to your null distribution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvisualize(null_dist) +\n  shade_p_value(obs_stat = test_stat, direction = \"two-sided\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ex-6-13-solutions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Extra Credit\n\n## Q4: Run a hypothesis test to answer the research question below: \n\nHow is gender related to citizenship status among people who live in the US? \n\nUse the `acs12` data. \n\n## a: What are your null and alternative hypotheses? \n\nNull: Gender is not related to citizenship status.\nAlternative: Gender is related to citizenship status.\n\n## b: What are the explanatory and response variables, and what types are they?
