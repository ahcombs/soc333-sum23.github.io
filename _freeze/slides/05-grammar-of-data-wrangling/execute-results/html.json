Go to [slido.com](https://www.slido.com/) / #sta199. You can also upvote others' questions.\n:::\n\n## Announcements\n\n-   Request videos for missed classes via the **video request form**\n-   Ask course questions **on Slack**\n    -   Using code formatting and proper indentation\n\n    -   Taking screenshots\n\n    -   Checking for previous questions\n\n## Questions from last time\n\n-   How come I had to **load** my packages each session before basic functions like `ggplot()` become available?\n-   Will we spend time learning more of the actual fundamental statistics needed to understand how the different graphs work and which ones are most useful for different data sets?\n\n## Coding style + workflow\n\n::: incremental\n-   Avoid long lines of code.\n\n    -   We should be able to see [all]{.underline} of your code in the PDF document you submit.\n\n-   Label code chunks.\n\n    -   Do **not** put spaces in the code-chunk `label`s.\n\n-   Render, commit, and push regularly.\n\n    -   Think about it like clicking to save regularly as you type a report.\n:::\n\n# Application exercise\n\n## `ae-03`\n\n::: appex\n-   Go to the course [GitHub org](https://github.com/sta199-f22-1) and find your `ae-03` (repo name will be suffixed with your GitHub name).\n-   Clone the repo in your container, open the Quarto document in the repo, and follow along and complete the exercises.\n-   Render, commit, and push your edits by the AE deadline (3 days from today).\n:::\n\n## Recap of AE {.smaller}\n\n-   The pipe operator, `|>`, can be read as \"and then\".\n-   The pipe operator passes what comes before it into the function that comes after it as the first argument in that function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(1, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 |> \n  sum(2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Always use a line break after the pipe, and indent the next line of code.\n    -   Just like always use a line break between layers of ggplots, after `+`, and indent the next line.\n",
