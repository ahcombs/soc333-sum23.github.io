Researchers surveyed 1000 British teenagers age 13-17 and found that higher rates of social media use are correlated with increased likelihood of anxiety and depression.\n2.  In 1951, Asch showed that social pressure led undergraduate men to conform to incorrect suggestions.\n3.  Using a longitudinal survey, researchers found that Americans who obtained a college degree between 1995 and 2000 got higher-paying jobs, on average, than people their age who did not obtain a college degree.\n\n## Revisiting p values\n\n## Exercise Q2: What's a p value?\n\n-   A. A measurement of the size of the effect in a statistical analysis\n-   B. The probability of drawing a sample equal to or more extreme than the one you have, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n-   C. The probability that the null hypothesis is true.\n-   D. The probability that the alternative hypothesis is true.\n\n## Exercise Q2: What's a p value?\n\n-   A. A measurement of the size of the effect in a statistical analysis\n-   **B. The probability of drawing a sample equal to or more extreme than the one you have, assuming the null hypothesis is true.**\n-   C. The probability that the null hypothesis is true.\n-   D. The probability that the alternative hypothesis is true.\n\n## P values are the current standard for determining whether a result is important...\n\nwhich is why we've spent time learning to calculate and interpret them\n\n. . .\n\nbut they have some major problems! And things might (/should) change in future.\n\n## Problems with p values: cutoffs\n\n::: incremental\n-   Hypothesis tests (and other statistics): results are either statistically significant or insignificant\n\n-   Cutoffs:\n\n    -   Most common: p = 0.05 (1 in 20 chance)\n    -   Sometimes: p = 0.1 (1 in 10), p = 0.01 (1 in 100), p = 0.001 (1 in 1000)\n    -   Often multiple are reported: e.g., result is significant at the 0.05 level and 0.01 level but not at the 0.001 level\n:::\n\n## Problems with p values: cutoffs\n\n::: incremental\n-   Why those cutoffs? Why not something else?\n\n    -   Absolutely no reason; they're just nice round numbers (yikes...)\n:::\n\n## The \"file drawer problem\"\n\n::: incremental\n-   Results with a p value of 0.04 are much more likely to be published than results with a p value of 0.06.\n-   But are those really that different?\n-   We lose a lot of information when we never hear about the studies at p = .06!\n:::\n\n## Dependence on sample size\n\n::: incremental\n-   We survey 200 people---100 living in North Carolina and 100 living in South Carolina---and ask them how happy they are on a scale of 1 to 10. We find that NC residents are .1 points happier than SC residents (NC mean 8.1, SC mean 8, standard deviation 2 points).\n\n    -   p = .72---statistically insignificant; fail to reject the null\n\n-   What if we instead survey 10000 people and find exactly the same thing?\n\n    -   p = .012---statistically significant!\n:::\n\n## Errors\n\n-   When there's a cutoff, there's the possibility of being wrong\n\n    -   In either direction: you can reject a null hypothesis that's true; you can fail to reject a null hypothesis that's false\n\n-   At p = 0.05, you will incorrectly reject the null (Type 1 error) 1 out of every 20 times--by design!\n\n![](images/18/errors.png)\n\n## Effect sizes are essential\n\n::: incremental\n-   Effect size: how *much* of a difference is there?\n\n    -   P values tell you nothing about how *big* an effect is\n\n    -   They are determined more by sample size than effect size\n\n    -   Big samples: you're more likely to find significant effects\n\n        -   But those effects can be tiny and meaningless\n\n    -   Small samples: you're less likely to find significant effects\n\n        -   So you can miss \"insignificant\" effects that are actually real and important\n:::\n\n## Effect sizes\n\n::: incremental\n-   Effect sizes come from descriptive statistics!\n\n-   What is the difference in mean/proportion/rate between groups?\n\n    -   Ex: People who live in urban areas have an average of 0.3 more friends than people who live in rural areas.\n\n-   For numeric explanatory variables: how much of a change in the response variable can we expect for a given amount of change in the explanatory variable?\n\n    -   Ex: An increase of one hour of social media use per day is associated with a 5% greater chance of being diagnosed with depression.\n:::\n\n## Effect sizes\n\n-   What is \"big enough\" to be important?\n\n. . .\n\n-   It's SUPER dependent on context (don't believe the internet when it tells you otherwise)\n\n## Effect sizes in relationship satisfaction\n\n::: incremental\n-   Study of 19000 people showed that people who met their spouses online were less likely to divorce (p \\< .002) and more likely to have high marital satisfaction (p \\< .001) than those who met their spouses offline.\n\n-   But what about the effect sizes?\n\n    -   Divorce rate: offline 7.67%; online 5.96%\n    -   Happiness (1-7 scale): offline 5.48; online 5.64\n\n-   It's statistically significant, but is it important?\n:::\n\n::: aside\nSources: 1.

Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 110, 10135--10140 (2013).\n:::\n\n## Different methods; different results\n\n-   P hacking: making different decisions about who to include/exclude or what your variables should be can change results dramatically\n\n. . .\n\n-   Different statistical methods can also give different results\n\n## Different methods; different results\n\n-   ![](images/18/soccer.png)\n\n::: aside\nSource: FiveThirtyEight. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/#part2\n:::\n\n## So what do we do??\n\n::: incremental\n-   Descriptive statistics! Pay attention to how big your effects are. Statistical significance alone doesn't make something important. Are the effects big enough to be meaningful?\n-   Be humble and be patient. One study doesn't prove something. But evidence accumulates over time.\n-   Repeat things. If you find the same result in two datasets, or if you find the same result using different methods, it's more likely to be real and meaningful.\n:::\n\n## Evidence accumulates\n\n![](images/18/soccer.png)\n\n## Objectivity in statistics\n\n::: incremental\n-   Objective analysis: 100% impartial, value-free, and unbiased\n\n    -   Sometimes people think that if something is supported by statistics---ie, if the work is quantitative---it's automatically objective (and qualitiative work is automatically not objective)\n\n-   But statistics has always reflected the values, beliefs, and experiences of those who practice it---just like qualitative methods, but more sneakily\n\n-   *Wait a minute---how do my values have anything to do with how I run a hypothesis test??*\n:::\n\n## Exercise Q3\n\n-   Values/beliefs/experiences come into it when analysts make decisions.\n-   Brainstorm: what are some decisions that people have to make in the course of an analysis?\n\n##  A few examples of statistical decisions\n\n::: incremental\n-   What questions to ask\n-   What data to use or collect (and from who)\n-   What variables to use and how to measure them\n-   What statistical methodology to use\n-   Which results to report\n-   How to interpret them\n:::\n\n## Statistics are not bad!\n\n::: incremental\n-   No method is 100% objective. But they can still be tremendously useful.\n-   Statistics can be rigorous and fair while also being guided by analysts' experiences and worldviews\n-   Analysts' values/experiences can *strengthen* statistics rather than compromise it\n:::\n\n## Good statistical practice\n\n-   A lot has been written about how to do statistics better---in particular, feminist and antiracist scholarship\n-   Is what you're reading using good practices?\n-   Is your own work using good practices?\n\n## Good practices: the highlights\n\n-   Transparency!\n\n    -   Analysts should talk about decisions, assumptions, and limitations\n    -   If work sounds super sensational, makes sweeping conclusions, or doesn't come with a list of caveats, there's probably a lack of transparency. Good science is slow and gradual!\n\n## Good practices: the highlights\n\n-   P values are fine, but think about effect sizes too!\n\n    -   Analysis is most powerful when both are used together\n    -   We \\<3 descriptive statistics!\n    -   Be skeptical of work that claims a significant effect and tells you nothing about how big it is\n\n## Good practices: the highlights\n\n-   Be mindful of how people treat and talk about social categories\n\n. . .\n\n-   Categories like sex and race don't \"cause\" social effects\n\n    -   Sex*ism* and rac*ism* that people in different categories experience differently cause social effects\n\n. . .\n\n-   Not all people in a category will experience the same thing\n\n    -   Statistical results are always approximations--there's a lot of variation in individual experiences!\n    -   Did the analyst consider the possibility of intersectional effects?\n    -   Don't believe sweeping claims about entire groups: \"All Asian-Americans...\"; \"People without college degrees need to do X...\"\n    \n. . .\n\n-   Whose experience is treated as the norm and why?\n\n    -   Older work tends to treat White people and men as a baseline, and compare other groups' experiences against theirs... but there are more principled approaches\n\n## The bottom line\n\n:::incremental\n-   Statistics is a useful and powerful tool!\n-   But it's not magic---it won't *automatically* give good results.\n-   Analysts have a lot of choices to make: what questions are answered, how they're answered, how the results are interpreted\n-   How those choices are made is important! And we're figuring out all the time how to do it better.\n:::\n\n## We're all done!\n\n-   Determine topic ✓\n-   Find data; learn what observations and variables are available ✓\n-   Write research question ✓\n-   Describe distributions of relevant variables ✓\n-   Prepare data frame for analysis ✓\n-   Describe relationships between variables ✓\n-   Perform statistical tests/write models ✓\n-   Communicate results ✓\n\n##\n\n:::{.r-stack}\n![](images/19/thanks.png)\n:::\n\n:::aside\nhttps://www.therandomvibez.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/thank-you-meme-puppy.jpg\n:::\n",
