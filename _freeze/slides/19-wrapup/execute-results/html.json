Push to GitHub.\n    -   Presentations and paper: instructions and paper example are up! \n    \n        -   Presentations: Thursday June 22 and Monday June 26\n        -   Paper: Draft Monday June 26, final Wednesday June 28\n:::\n\n## Workshopping the project: your feedback\n\n:::incremental\n-   Why workshop? My theories:\n\n    -   You start your work sooner---less crunch right before the deadline; you have an opportunity to ask questions if you get stuck\n    -   Both giving and getting feedback are useful for learning this stuff\n    \n-   But maybe it doesn't work--that's okay too\n\n-   Tell me (anonymously): \n\n    -   Do you think workshopping the proposal and results was a good use of class time? Why or why not?\n    -   What has been useful about this structure for you (submitting drafts for grading first, workshopping, then later submitting for grading)?\n    -   What has not been useful/what would you change about it for next time? \n    -   Any other comments for me? \n:::\n\n## Today {.smaller}\n\n-   Finishing up limitations and causality\n-   Directions for future research\n-   Problems with p values\n\n## Last time\n\n-   Limitations: Your work can't tell you everything!\n\n    -   Sampling and generalizability: are the people in your sample similar enough to the people in your target population?\n    -   Accuracy: is your data correct?\n    -   Operationalization: did the people who collected the data measure what you would have wanted them to measure in the way you would have wanted it to be measured?\n    -   Causality: do your results tell you something about *why* something happens? Or just about what is happening?\n    \n## Association vs causation\n\n. . .\n\n-   Association: two things are related\n-   Causation: one thing drives another thing\n\n## Requirements for determining causation\n\n::: incremental\n-   Covariance: There has to be a relationship between two variables\n\n-   Plausibility and spuriousness: does it pass a gut check? do we know that there isn't a third variable driving both things?\n\n    -   Example: Ice cream sales are highly correlated with violent crime rates.\n    -   <https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations>\n    -   Experiments take care of this!\n\n-   Time order: did the cause happen before the effect?\n\n    -   Do we know that for sure, or is it ambiguous based on our data?\n    -   Consider *reverse causality*\n    -   Example: We survey 1000 people and find that people who have desk jobs are less healthy than people who have active jobs.\n:::\n\n## Exercise Q1\n\nAre these statements causal or associative?\n\n1.  Higher rates of social media use are correlated with increased likelihood of anxiety and depression among teenagers.\n2.  Social pressure leads people to give answers they know are incorrect.\n3.  People who graduate from college get higher-paying jobs, on average, than people who do not graduate.\n\n## Exercise Q1 solutions\n\nAre these statements causal or associative?\n\n:::incremental\n1.  Higher rates of social media use are correlated with increased likelihood of anxiety and depression among teenagers.\n\n    -   Associative\n    \n2.  Social pressure leads people to conform to ideas they know are incorrect.\n\n    -   Causal\n    \n3.  People who graduate from college get higher-paying jobs, on average, than people who do not graduate.\n\n    -   Associative\n:::\n\n## A brief tangent: The Asch Conformity Line Experiment\n\n:::incremental\n-   Which of the lines on the right (A, B, or C) is most like the target line?\n-   What if six people before you all said B?\n-   Result: 75% of subjects (male-identifying undergraduate students at one university) gave at least one obviously wrong answer over the course of 12 trials. Less than 1% did in a control condition.\n:::\n\n![](images/18/asch.png)\n\n## Exercise Q2: Identifying limitations\n\n-   Write down a limitation for each of the following:\n\n1.  Researchers surveyed 1000 British teenagers age 13-17 and found that higher rates of social media use are correlated with increased likelihood of anxiety and depression.\n2.  In 1951, Asch showed that social pressure led undergraduate men to conform to incorrect suggestions.\n3.  Using a longitudinal survey, researchers found that Americans who obtained a college degree between 1995 and 2000 got higher-paying jobs, on average, than people their age who did not obtain a college degree.\n\n## Turning limitations into next steps\n\n::: incremental\n-   Limitations don't have to be bad. Imperfect data is often still useful.\n-   Your limitations are often where ideas for future research come from.\n-   Can you think of ways to address the limitations in a future study?\n:::\n\n## More on directions for future research\n\n-   Future research builds on current research\n-   Is there a new population to extend to? \n-   Is there a logical next question to ask now that you know your results? \n\n    -   Often that question is \"why?\"\n\n-   Are there practical consequences of the results, and do those require further research to understand or mitigate?\n\n## Exercise Q3: Brainstorming directions for future research\n\n-   Write down an idea for a follow up study for each of these: \n\n1.  Researchers surveyed 1000 British teenagers age 13-17 and found that higher rates of social media use are correlated with increased likelihood of anxiety and depression.\n2.  In 1951, Asch showed that social pressure led undergraduate men to conform to incorrect suggestions.\n3.  Using a longitudinal survey, researchers found that Americans who obtained a college degree between 1995 and 2000 got higher-paying jobs, on average, than people their age who did not obtain a college degree.\n\n# Revisiting p values\n\n## Exercise Q4: What's a p value? \n\nA. A measurement of the effect size in a statistical analysis\nB. The probability of drawing a sample equal to or more extreme than the one you have, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\nC. The probability that the null hypothesis is true.\nD. The probability that the alternative hypothesis is true.\n\n## Problems with p values\n\n-   arbitrary cutoffs\n-   file drawer problem\n-   doesn't pay attention to whether the effect is important\n-   sometimes you reject when you shouldn't (5% of the time)\n-   sometimes you don't reject when you should\n\n## Solutions: best analysis practices\n\n-   descriptive statistics! pay attention to effect sizes.\n-   repeat things! use different data or different analysis techniques. If you get the same thing twice you're less likely to be wrong.\n\n## Objectivity: no one is objective\n-   mesearch is helpful sometimes\n\n## Statistics reflects biases\n\n-   It's not objective\n-   We make choices that have implications\n-   Treating all members of a group as the same\n-   Reference categories\n-   How we pick categories--what options are offered. Treating categories as fixed when maybe they shouldn't be.\n-   How to combat? Make good choices. If you can't fix it, you can point it out as a limitation\n\n## Media reports: use Joseph's material\n\n## Ethics? \n",
