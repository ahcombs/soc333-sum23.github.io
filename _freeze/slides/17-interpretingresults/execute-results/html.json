No class Monday. We're almost there! :)\n\n## Wrapping up the project\n\n-   Project component 3: submit for grading by next Tuesday (June 20)\n\n. . .\n\n-   Final paper\n\n    -   use (revised!) elements of your proposal, descriptive stats, and results to turn your question and analysis into a (concise) paper.\n    -   More detailed instructions and example will be posted soon\n    -   Due Wednesday June 28 11:59pm\n\n. . .\n\n-   Final presentation\n\n    -   Short! \\~5-10 minutes\n    -   Briefly introduce your question, say a bit about why it's interesting, show your results, and talk about what you conclude from them.\n    -   Most on Monday June 26 (last day of class)\n\n## Final presentation logistics\n\n-   **Looking for a few volunteers to go on Thursday June 22 instead!**\n\n    -   Benefits...\n    -   More time afterwards to focus on your final paper (finish up the semester early?)\n    -   No stress while you watch day 2\n    -   Everyone gets more flexibility on time\n    -   What's your favorite kind of donut? :)\n\n## Today {.smaller}\n\n-   Interpreting results!\n\n## Yesterday's exercise\n\n## The (approximate) data analysis process {.smaller}\n\n-   Determine topic ✓\n-   Find data; learn what observations and variables are available ✓\n-   Write research question ✓\n-   Describe distributions of relevant variables ✓\n-   Prepare data frame for analysis ✓\n-   Describe relationships between variables ✓\n-   Perform statistical tests ✓\n-   **Communicate results**\n\n## So you have a p value...\n\n-   Rejecting/failing to reject hypotheses is useful\n-   But it's also statistics-speak, not effective communication\n\n## What do you want to be able to say?\n\n-   Something about what the world is like!\n-   Translate back from hypothesis test language---zoom back out. If you were describing your results to a friend, what would you say you learned about the world?\n\n## What *can't* we say?\n\n::: incremental\n-   Knowing the limitations of your conclusions is super important!\n-   Limitations can arise from several places.\n:::\n\n## Sampling and generalizability\n\n::: incremental\n-   Who can your results speak to?\n-   Is your sample big enough?\n-   Was it selected randomly?\n:::\n\n## Accuracy\n\n::: incremental\n-   Are people likely to give you accurate answers?\n\n-   Unintentional inaccuracies\n\n    -   Desirability biases\n    -   Memory problems\n\n-   Misrepresenting/lying\n\n    -   Is your data coming from something or someone who has a stake in it?\n\n-   Saying vs doing\n\n    -   What people say is often different than what they do\n    -   Stated ideals often don't match up with actions\n    -   \"I believe in equality but I oppose all the policies that would create it\"\n    -   Did your data collect information on saying, or on doing?\n    -   Avoid drawing conclusions about what people would do when the data you have is about what they say\n:::\n\n## Operationalization\n\n::: incremental\n-   Are the questions and categories what you would like them to be?\n\n-   Do we lose information through bad category choice or bad documentation?\n\n    -   For example: bad but common operationalizations\n\n        -   Race: white or nonwhite\n        -   Gender: male or female\n:::\n\n## Causality\n\n-   Association vs causation: What's the difference?\n\n. . .\n\n-   Association: two things are related\n-   Causation: one thing drives another thing\n\n. . .\n\n-   It's nice to be able to say something about causation, but it's hard!\n-   Hypothesis tests speak to association. They *sometimes* speak to causation as well---it all depends on the set up of your study!\n\n## Exercise Q1\n\n-   Does this provide evidence that using the internet helps people live longer? Why or why not?\n-   Write down a plausible explanation for this relationship.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-interpretingresults_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Reading for Tuesday\n\n-   There's an article linked on the course calendar. Mess around with the interactive element!\n\n## Workshopping results\n\n-   Teams\n\n-   Same as last time: you have access to each other's repos on GitHub. Leave your feedback as an issue. Questions to address are at the top of the instructions page on the website ([link](https://soc333-sum23.github.io/project-results.html)).\n",
