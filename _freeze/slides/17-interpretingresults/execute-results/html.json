No class Monday. We're almost there! :)\n\n## Wrapping up the project\n\n-   Project component 3: submit for grading by next Tuesday (June 20)\n\n. . .\n\n-   Final paper\n\n    -   use (revised!) elements of your proposal, descriptive stats, and results to turn your question and analysis into a (concise) paper.\n    -   More detailed instructions and example will be posted soon\n    -   Due Wednesday June 28 11:59pm\n\n. . .\n\n-   Final presentation\n\n    -   Short! \\~5-10 minutes\n    -   Briefly introduce your question, say a bit about why it's interesting, show your results, and talk about what you conclude from them.\n    -   Most on Monday June 26 (last day of class)\n\n## Final presentation logistics\n\n-   **Looking for a few volunteers to go on Thursday June 22 instead!**\n\n    -   Benefits...\n    -   More time afterwards to focus on your final paper (finish up the semester early?)\n    -   No stress while you watch day 2\n    -   Everyone gets more flexibility on time\n    -   What's your favorite kind of donut? :)\n\n## Today{.smaller}\n\n-   Interpreting results!\n\n## Yesterday's exercise\n\n## The (approximate) data analysis process {.smaller}\n\n-   Determine topic ✓\n-   Find data; learn what observations and variables are available ✓\n-   Write research question ✓\n-   Describe distributions of relevant variables ✓\n-   Prepare data frame for analysis ✓\n-   Describe relationships between variables ✓\n-   Perform statistical tests ✓\n-   **Communicate results**\n\n## So you have a p value...\n\n-   Rejecting/failing to reject hypotheses is useful\n-   But it's also statistics-speak, not effective communication\n\n## What do you want to be able to say?\n\n-   Something about what the world is like!\n-   Translate back from hypothesis test language---zoom back out. If you were describing your results to a friend, what would you say you learned about the world?\n\n## What *can't* we say? \n\n::: incremental\n-   Knowing the limitations of your conclusions is super important!\n-   Limitations can arise from several places.\n:::\n\n## Sampling and generalizability\n\n:::incremental\n-   Who can your results speak to? \n-   Is your sample big enough? \n-   Was it selected randomly? \n:::\n\n## Accuracy\n\n:::incremental\n-   Are people likely to give you accurate answers?\n-   Unintentional inaccuracies\n\n    -   Desirability biases\n    -   Memory problems\n\n-   Misrepresenting/lying\n    \n    -   Is your data coming from something or someone who has a stake in it?\n    \n-   Saying vs doing\n    \n    -   What people say is often different than what they do\n    -   Stated ideals often don't match up with actions\n    -   \"I believe in equality but I oppose all the policies that would create it\"\n    -   Did your data collect information on saying, or on doing? \n    -   Avoid drawing conclusions about what people would do when the data you have is about what they say\n:::\n\n## Operationalization\n\n:::incremental\n-   Are the questions and categories what you would like them to be? \n-   Do we lose information through bad category choice or bad documentation? \n\n    -   For example: bad but common operationalizations\n        \n        -   Race: white or nonwhite\n        -   Gender: male or female\n:::\n        \n## Causality\n\n-   Association vs causation: What's the difference?\n\n. . .\n\n-   Association: two things are related\n-   Causation: one thing drives another thing\n\n. . .\n\n-   It's nice to be able to say something about causation, but it's hard!\n-   Hypothesis tests speak to association. They *sometimes* speak to causation as well---it all depends on the set up of your study!\n\n## Exercise Q1\n\n-   Does this provide evidence that using the internet helps people live longer? Why or why not?\n-   Write down a plausible explanation for this relationship.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-interpretingresults_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Requirements for causation\n\n::: incremental\n-   Plausibility: does it pass a gut check?\n\n    -   https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations\n\n-   Time order: did the cause happen before the effect?\n\n    -   Do we know that for sure, or is it ambiguous based on our data?\n    -   Consider *reverse causality*\n    -   Example: We survey 1000 people and find that people who have desk jobs are less healthy than people who have active jobs.\n\n-   Nonspuriousness: do we know that there isn't a third variable driving both things?\n\n    -   Example: Ice cream sales are highly correlated with violent crime rates.\n    -   Experiments take care of this!\n:::\n\n## Exercise Q2\n\nAre these statements causal or associative?\n\n1.  Increased social media use is correlated with higher rates of anxiety and depression among teenagers.\n2.  Stronger economic growth leads to increased carbon dioxide pollution.\n3.  People who graduate from college get higher-paying jobs, on average, than people who do not graduate.\n\n## Turning limitations into next steps\n\n:::incremental\n-   Limitations don't have to be bad. Imperfect data is often still useful.\n-   Your limitations are often where ideas for future research come from.\n-   Can you think of ways to address the limitations in a future study?\n:::\n\n## Reading for Tuesday\n\n-   There's an article linked on the course calendar. Mess around with the interactive element!\n\n\n",
