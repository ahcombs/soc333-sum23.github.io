Explain why or why not.\n    If not, which will you include and which will you exclude?\n\n    I will not analyze all of the observations in my data set because analyzing all of them would make for an unfair comparison. There is a different set of sports available for men than for women. \n    I am interested in comparing the number of coaches for comparable men's and women's teams, so I will exclude sports for which there are only men's teams or only women's teams (e.g., football, softball).\n\n-   If necessary, use the code chunk below to filter out observations which are not relevant to your research question (not required if you will analyze all of your observations).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# first, I need to figure out which sports have teams for both genders\ntable(sports$sport, sports$teamgender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                           \n                            men women\n  All Track Combined         36    36\n  Baseball                   38     0\n  Basketball                 38    38\n  Fencing                    38    38\n  Field Hockey                0    38\n  Football                   38     0\n  Golf                       38    38\n  Gymnastics                  0    19\n  Lacrosse                   38    38\n  Rowing                      0    38\n  Soccer                     38    38\n  Softball                    0    24\n  Swimming and Diving        38    38\n  Tennis                     38    38\n  Track and Field X Country   2     2\n  Volleyball                  0    38\n  Wrestling                  38     0\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# from that table, I can see that I need to remove baseball, field hockey, football, gymnastics, rowing, softball, volleyball, and wrestling.\nsports_filtered <- sports |> \n  filter(\n    sport != \"Baseball\",\n    sport != \"Field Hockey\",\n    sport != \"Football\",\n    sport != \"Gymnastics\",\n    sport != \"Rowing\",\n    sport != \"Softball\",\n    sport != \"Volleyball\",\n    sport != \"Wrestling\"\n  )\n\n# did it work?

Hint: use the `useNA = \"always\"` option if using `table()`. `summary()` will provide the number of NAs in the data if there are any---if the output contains no information about them, there are none in the data.\n    -   In \\~2-3 sentences, describe what you see in the results. Note anything that surprises you.\n\n**ncoaches:**\n\nThe minimum number of coaches per team is one, the median is three, and the maximum is 14.\nThere are no missing values.\nThe fourth quartile is much wider than the other three (spanning from 4-14), and the mean (3.9) is larger than the median, suggesting that the data may be skewed to the right.\nIn other words, there may be a small number of teams with a large number of coaches relative to the rest.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(sports_filtered$ncoaches)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Depending on your variable types, this might be a scatter plot, box plot, bar chart, etc. Include meaningful axis labels.\n\n-   Interpret your plot in a few sentences. Does it appear these variables are associated with one another? Does anything about the relationship surprise you? Is it consistent or inconsistent with your hypothesis?\n\n    As suggested by the univariate summary statistics, the distribution of the number of coaches is skewed to the right. The distributions look nearly identical for men's and women's teams, so it appears that team gender and staffing levels are probably not associated with one another. This is consistent with my hypothesis and is not very surprising, though I was not expecting the distributions to be as extraordinarily similar as they appear here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# I have one numeric and one categorical variable, so a boxplot (as in example code in the assignment template) would also be a good choice here--but for variety I will show the same information in histogram form\nggplot(data = sports_filtered, aes(x = ncoaches, fill = teamgender)) + \n  geom_histogram(\n    position = position_dodge(), # this puts the bars next to each other\n    binwidth = 1\n    ) + \n  labs(x = \"Number of coaches\",\n       y = \"Number of teams\",\n       title = \"Distribution of staffing levels by team gender for Duke and UNC sports\",\n       fill = \"Team gender\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](c2_descriptives_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
