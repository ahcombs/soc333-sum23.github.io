How would you find this out?*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmutate(acs12, \n       long_commute = case_when(XXXX ~ \"yes\",\n                                XXXX ~ \"no\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nEdit the above code to give this new dataset a name (aka, save it as an object).\n\n*hint: this is what `<-` is for*\n\nThen look at it in the data viewer (click its name in the \"Environment\" panel).\nDoes it look like your new variable worked as you expected?\n\n## Q2\n\nCreate a version of `acs12` with a new variable called `collegeplus`.\nIt should have the value `TRUE` if someone has a college or graduate school degree and `FALSE` if not.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacs12_collegeplus <- mutate(acs12,\n                            collegeplus = XXXX)\n```\n:::\n\n\nCheck your work by creating a table that shows you if your new variable maps onto the old variable in the way you expect.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(XXXX, XXXX, useNA = \"always\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Extra credit\n\nCreate a new variable that indicates whether someone works a.\nnot at all (0 work hours), b.\npart time (1-30 hours), c.\nfull time (30-50 hours), or d.\ntoo much (50+ hours).\nCheck the data to see if it worked correctly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacs12_workcat <- mutate(acs12,\n                        XXXX = case_when(hrs_work == 0 ~ \"not at all\",\n                                         XXXX ~ XXXX,\n                                         XXXX ~ XXXX,\n                                         XXXX ~ XXXX))\n```\n:::\n\n\nCreate a new variable that indicates whether someone is an English-speaking citizen, a non-English speaking citizen, an English-speaking non-citizen, or a non-English speaking non-citizen.\nCheck the data to see if it worked correctly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacs12_citizenlanguage <- mutate(acs12,\n                                XXXX = XXXX)\n```\n:::\n\n\nDo the same thing as above, but this time use `|>` to provide the `acs12` dataset to the function\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacs12 |> \n  mutate(XXXX)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUsing pipes (`|>`), create a variable that indicates whether someone is a married woman, unmarried woman, married man, or unmarried man, then remove all minors (less than 18 years old) from the dataset.\nCheck your work using tables, summary statistics, and/or by looking at the data frame.\n*This one is challenging!*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Submit\n\nAs usual, submit your work by committing your changes and then pushing to github!\nPlease submit before class on Tuesday 6-6.\n",
