Load in the data set called `education-disease` and answer the following questions below.\nb.  How many levels of education are there in these data? How many levels of disease are there? **Hint:** The `distinct()` function might be helpful.\nc.  Convert the data to a two-way table where each cell is the number of people falling into each combination of Disease and Education. **Hint:** Use `count` and `pivot_wider`. Your answer should be a 4x3 data frame with counts in each cell.\n\nUsing the summary table you created in part (c), answer the remaining questions.\nYou do not have to use R functions for your calculations, you can use R as a calculator using the values from the summary table.\nMake sure to show your work, i.e., instead of reporting just the final answer, use R to calculate that in a way we can see the counts you've used along the way.\n\nd.  What is the probability of a random individual being high risk for cardiovascular disease?\ne.  What is the probability of a random individual having high school or GED education and not being high risk for cardiovascular disease?\nf.  What is the probability that a random individual who is already high risk for cardiovascular disease has a college education?\n\n::: callout-important\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 2 renders, commits, and pushes, another team member should pull their changes and render the document.\nThen, they should write the answer to Exercise 3.\nAll others should contribute to the discussion but only one person should type up the answer, render the document, commit, and push to GitHub.\nAll others should **not** touch the document.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 3 - Computer store\n\nIn a computer store, 30% of the computers in stock are laptops and 70% are desktops.\nFive percent of the laptops are on sale, while 10% of the desktops are on sale.[^1]\n\n[^1]: This exercise was adapted from Mind on Statistics, 5th Ed.\n    By Utts and Heckard.\n\na.  Fill in the code below to create a hypothetical two-way table to represent this situation. Assume the total number of computers is 1000.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- tibble( \n  type = c(),\n  sale = c(),\n  values = ()\n  )\n\ndata |>\n  pivot_wider( \n    names_from = ...,\n    values_from = ....\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n(b) Calculate the probability of that a randomly selected computer will be a desktop, given that the computer is on sale.\n\n(c) In your own words, explain what this probability means.\n\n::: callout-important\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 3 renders, commits, and pushes, another team member should pull their changes and render the document.\nThen, they should write the answer to Exercise 4.\nAll others should contribute to the discussion but only one person should type up the answer, render the document, commit, and push to GitHub.\nAll others should **not** touch the document.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 4 - Bike rentals\n\nBike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic.\nYou are tasked to investigate the relationship between the temperature outside and the number of bikes rented in the Washington DC area between the years 2011 and 2022.\nYou will be investigating data for the months June, July, September, and November.[^2]\n\n[^2]: Data subset from Progress in Artificial Intelligence, 2013.\n\nBelow is a list of variables and their definitions:\n\n| Variable  | Definition                                                                     |\n|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------------|\n| `season`  | Numerical representation of Spring (2), Summer (3), and Fall (4)               |\n| `year`    | Numerical representation of 2011 (0) or 2012 (1)                               |\n| `month`   | Month in which data were collected                                             |\n| `holiday` | Indicator variable for whether data were collected on a holiday (1) or not (0) |\n| `weekday` | Numerical representation of day of week                                        |\n| `temp`    | Temperature in Celsius                                                         |\n| `count`   | Number of bike rentals for that day                                            |\n\n(a) Read in the data. Then, create a scatter plot that investigates the relationship between the number of bikes rented and the temperature outside. Include a straight line of best fit to help discuss the discovered relationship. Summarize your findings in 2-3 sentences.\n(b) Another researcher suggests to look at the relationship between bikes rented and temperature by each of the four months of interest. Recreate your plot in part a, and color the points by month. Include a straight line for each of the four months to help discuss each month's relationship between bikes rented and temperature. In 3-4 sentences, summarize your findings.\n\nPlease watch the following video on Simpson's Paradox [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebEkn-BiW5k).\nAfter you do, please answer the following questions.\n\n(c) In your own words, summarize Simpson's Paradox in 2-3 sentences.\n\n(d) Compare and contrast your findings from part (a) and part (b).\n    What's different?\n\n(e) Think critically about your answer to part d.\n    What other context from this study could be creating this paradox?\n    That is, identify a potential confounding variable in this study.\n    Be sure to justify how your example could be a potential confounding variable by relating it back to both bike rentals and temperature.\n\n::: callout-important\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 4 renders, commits, and pushes, **all other team members** should pull the changes and render the document.\nFinally, a team member different than the one responsible for typing up responses to Exercise 4 should do the last task outlined below.\n:::\n\n## Closing an issue with a commit\n\nGo to your GitHub repository, you will see an issue with the title \"Learn to close an issue with a commit\".\nYour goal is to close this issue with a commit to practice this workflow, which is the workflow you will use when you are addressing feedback on your projects.\n\n-   Go to the relevant section in your lab .qmd file.\n-   Delete the sentence that says \"Delete me\".\n-   Render the document.\n-   Commit your changes from the git tab with the commit message *\"Delete sentence, closes #1.\"*\n-   Push your changes to your repo and observe that the issue is now closed and the commit associated with this move is linked from the issue.\n\nGitHub allows you to close an issue directly with commits if the commit uses one of the following keywords followed bu the issue number (which you can find next to the issue title): close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, and resolved.\n\n# Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.\nWe will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to render and push changes.\n\nYou must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page by the submission deadline to be considered \"on time\".\n\nMake sure your data are tidy!\nThat is, your code should not be running off the pages and spaced properly.\nSee: <https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html>.\n:::\n\nTo submit your assignment:\n\n-   Go to <http://www.gradescope.com> and click *Log in* in the top right corner.\n-   Click *School Credentials* $\\rightarrow$ *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.\n-   Click on your *STA 199* course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with exercise. All the pages of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be \"checked\"). *If you do not do this, you will be subject to lose points on the assignment.*\n-   Select the first page of your .pdf submission to be associated with the *\"Workflow & formatting\"* question.\n\n# Grading\n\n| Component             | Points |\n|:----------------------|:-------|\n| Ex 1                  | 4      |\n| Ex 2                  | 14     |\n| Ex 3                  | 11     |\n| Ex 4                  | 16     |\n| Workflow & formatting | 5      |\n| **Total**             | **50** |\n\n::: callout-note\nThe \"Workflow & formatting\" component assesses the reproducible workflow.\nThis includes:\n\n-   having at least 3 informative commit messages\n-   labeling the code chunks\n-   having readable code that does not exceed 80 characters, i.e., we can read all your code in the rendered PDF\n-   each team member contributing to the repo with commits at least once\n-   the issue being closed with a commit message\n:::\n",
