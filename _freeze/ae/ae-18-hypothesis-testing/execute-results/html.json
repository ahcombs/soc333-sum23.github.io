Do this in both words *and* in proper notation.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n# Observed data\n\nOur goal is to use calculate the probability of a sample statistic at least as extreme as the one observed in our data if in fact the null hypothesis is true.\n\n-   **Demo:** Calculate and report the sample statistic below using proper notation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n$$\\bar{x} = 76.6$$\n\n# The null distribution\n\nLet's use simulation-based methods to conduct the hypothesis test specified above.\n\n## Generate\n\nWe'll start by generating the null distribution.\n\n-   **Demo:** Generate the null distribution?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(4321)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Your turn:** Take a look at `null_dist`. What does each element in this distribution represent?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Visualize\n\n-   **Question:** Before you visualize the distribution of `null_dist` -- at what value would you expect this distribution to be centered? Why?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n-   **Demo:** Create an appropriate visualization for your null distribution. Does the center of the distribution match what you guessed in the previous question?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Demo:** Now, add a vertical red line on your null distribution that represents your sample statistic.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Question:** Based on the position of this line, does your observed sample mean appear to be an unusual observation under the assumption of the null hypothesis?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n# p-value\n\nAbove, we eyeballed how likely/unlikely our observed mean is.\nNow, let's actually quantify it using a p-value.\n\n-   **Question:** What is a p-value?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n-   **Demo:** Visualize the p-value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Your turn:** What is the p-value?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n# Conclusion\n\n-   **Your turn:** What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test based on the p-value you calculated? Make sure to frame it in context of the data and the research question. Use a significance level of 5% to make your conclusion.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n-   **Demo:** Interpret the p-value in context of the data and the research question.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n# Get real...\n\n-   **Question:** What we did above was a \"toy example\" to illustrate hypothesis test. What would you change to make this a real, more robust analysis?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n-   **Demo:** Work through the analysis again with these changes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add-code-here\n```\n:::\n",
