Make a histogram. Set an appropriate binwidth.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  Make a boxplot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n3.  Based on these, determine if each of the following statements about the shape of the distribution is true or false.\n    -   The distribution of penguin weights in this sample is left skewed. **FALSE**\n    -   The distribution of penguin weights in this sample is unimodal. **TRUE**\n\n## Two variables\n\n::: callout-note\nAnalyzing the relationship between two variables is called **bivariate** analysis.\n:::\n\nCreate visualizations of the distribution of `weight`s of penguins by `species`.\n\n4.  Make a single histogram. Set an appropriate binwidth.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n5.  Use multiple histograms via faceting, one for each species. Set an appropriate binwidth, add color as you see fit, and turn off legends if not needed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n6.  Use side-by-side box plots. Add color as you see fit and turn off legends if not needed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n7.  Use density plots. Add color as you see fit.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n8.  Use violin plots. Add color as you see fit and turn off legends if not needed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n9.  Make a jittered scatter plot. Add color as you see fit and turn off legends if not needed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n10. Use beeswarm plots. Add color as you see fit and turn off legends if not needed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n11. Use multiple geoms on a single plot. Be deliberate about the order of plotting. Change the theme and the color scale of the plot. Finally, add informative labels.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Multiple variables\n\n::: callout-note\nAnalyzing the relationship between three or more variables is called **multivariate** analysis.\n:::\n\n12. Facet the plot you created in the previous exercise by `island`. Adjust labels accordingly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nBefore you continue, let's turn off all warnings the code chunks generate and resize all figures.\nWe'll do this by editing the YAML.\n\n## Visualizing other variables - Your turn!\n\n13. Pick a single categorical variable from the data set and make a bar plot of its distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n14. Pick two categorical variables and make a visualization to visualize the relationship between the two variables. Along with your code and output, provide an interpretation of the visualization.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nInterpretation goes here...\n\n15. Make another plot that uses at least three variables. At least one should be numeric and at least one categorical. In 1-2 sentences, describe what the plot shows about the relationships between the variables you plotted. Don't forget to label your code chunk.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nInterpretation goes here...\n",
