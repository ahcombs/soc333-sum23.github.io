How many variables? How many observations? Can you find the data online? Try looking for it for at least 3 minutes with a partner.\n\n*Add your response here.*\n\n-   **Demo:** Load the data for this survey from `data/survation.csv`. First confirm that the data match the percentages from the visualization. Then, recreate the visualization, and improve it. Does the improved visualization look different than the original? Does it send a different message at a first glance?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n",
