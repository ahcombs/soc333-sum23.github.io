Describe your use.\n\n*Add your response here.*\n\n-   What is meant by \"stochastic *parrots*\" in the paper title?\n\n*Add your response here.*\n\n# Part 2 - Predicting ethnicity\n\n**Your turn (12 minutes):** Imai and Khanna (2016) built a racial prediction algorithm using a Bayes classifier trained on voter registration records from Florida and the U.S.\nCensus Bureau's name list.\n\n-   The following is the title and the abstract of the paper. Take a minute to read them.\n\n> [Improving Ecological Inference by Predicting Individual Ethnicity from Voter Registration Record](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/race.html) (Imran and Khan, 2016)\n\n> In both political behavior research and voting rights litigation, turnout and vote choice for different racial groups are often inferred using aggregate election results and racial composition.\n> Over the past several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem.\n> We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records.\n> Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes's rule to combine the Census Bureau's Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records.\n> We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using approximately nine million voter registration records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity is available.\n> We find that it is possible to reduce the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6% and 3%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above 80%.\n> Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and find that our estimates yields substantially less amounts of bias and root mean squared error than standard ecological inference estimates.\n> We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology.\n> The open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.\n\nThe said \"source software\" is the **wru** package: <https://github.com/kosukeimai/wru>.\n\n-   Then, if you feel comfortable, load the **wru** package and try it out using the sample data provided in the package. And if you don't feel comfortable doing so, take a look at the results below. Was the publication of this model ethical? Does the open-source nature of the code affect your answer? Is it ethical to use this software? Does your answer change depending on the intended use?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(wru)\n\npredict_race(voter.file = voters, surname.only = TRUE) %>% \n  select(surname, pred.whi, pred.bla, pred.his, pred.asi, pred.oth)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      surname    pred.whi    pred.bla     pred.his    pred.asi    pred.oth\n1      Khanna 0.045110474 0.003067623 0.0068522723 0.860411906 0.084557725\n2        Imai 0.052645440 0.001334812 0.0558160072 0.719376581 0.170827160\n3      Rivera 0.043285692 0.008204605 0.9136195794 0.024316883 0.010573240\n4     Fifield 0.895405704 0.001911388 0.0337464844 0.011079323 0.057857101\n5        Zhou 0.006572555 0.001298962 0.0005388581 0.982365594 0.009224032\n6    Ratkovic 0.861236727 0.008212824 0.0095395642 0.011334635 0.109676251\n7     Johnson 0.543815322 0.344128607 0.0272403940 0.007405765 0.077409913\n8       Lopez 0.038939877 0.004920643 0.9318797791 0.012154125 0.012105576\n10 Wantchekon 0.330697188 0.194700665 0.4042849478 0.021379541 0.048937658\n9       Morse 0.866360147 0.044429853 0.0246568086 0.010219712 0.054333479\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Add your response here.*\n\n-   If you have installed the package, re-run the code, this time to see what the package predicts for your race.
