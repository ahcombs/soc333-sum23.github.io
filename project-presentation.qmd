# Presentation + slides {#presentation-slides}

## Slides

In addition to the written report, you will also create presentation slides and deliver a presentation that summarizes and showcases your project.
Introduce your research question and data set, showcase visualizations, and discuss the primary conclusions.
These slides should serve as a brief visual addition to your written report and will be graded for content and quality.

You can create your slides with any software you like (Keynote, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.).

::: callout-note
You can also use Quarto to make your slides!
While we won't be covering making slides with Quarto in the class, I am happy to help you with it in office hours.
It's no different than writing other documents with Quarto, so the learning curve will not be steep!
:::

The slide deck should have about 6 content slides + 1 title slide.
Here is a *suggested* outline as you think through the slides; you [**do not**]{.underline} have to use this exact format for the 6 slides.

-   Title Slide
-   Slide 1: Introduce the topic and motivation
-   Slide 2: Introduce the data
-   Slide 3: Highlights of the descriptive statistics
-   Slide 4-5: Results: Inference/modeling/other analysis
-   Slide 6: Conclusions + future work

## Presentation {#presentation}

Presentations will take place in class during the last class of the semester (**Monday June 26**).
**The presentation should be about 5 minutes**.
There will be time for a few questions after each presentation.

## Grading criteria

The presentation is clear and informative.
The slides are neat, professional, and support rather than distract from the presenter.
