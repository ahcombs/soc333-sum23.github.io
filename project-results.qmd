# Results {#results}

In this component, you will test your hypothesis and present the results of your test(s).

## Details

Bring a full draft of this component to class for peer review on DATE.

Incorporate your peer feedback and turn in a version for grading on DATE.

The required elements of this component are as follows:

-   Part 1: Analysis plan

    -   State your research question, hypothesis, and variables you intend to use (from the proposal, updated as necessary).
    -   Select an analytic method to use to answer this question. This must be either an inferential method or a linear regression.
    -   Explain why your chosen method is appropriate for your question and your variables
    -   What are the limitations of this strategy?

-   Part 2: Analysis results

    -   Perform the analysis you described in part 1.
    -   Present the results as either a figure or a table, as appropriate.
    -   Interpret your results. What do they tell you about your research question? Do they support your hypothesis?
    -   What *don't* your results tell you about your research question? In other words, what are some reasonable next steps for future research in this area?

## Why?

It is generally not very convincing to only show descriptive statistics of your sample, because ultimately, we do not care about your sample specifically--we want to know something about the entire target population.
If you were somehow able to measure the entire target population, would you be likely to see the same pattern?
Inferential statistics allow you to answer that question.

Completing this component will allow you the chance to receive feedback on your analytic strategy and refine it prior to submitting your full paper.
