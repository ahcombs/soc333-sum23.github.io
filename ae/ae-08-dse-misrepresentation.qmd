-   **Question:** What is wrong with the visualization above?

*Add your response here.*

-   **Your turn (5 minutes):** The data from this poll are at `data/gbpoll.csv`.
    First, load the data and confirm the number of responses match those mentioned in the tweet.

    ```{r}
    #| label: gbpoll-data

    # add code here
    ```

    Then, confirm that the proportions of intended votes match those mentioned in the tweet.

    ```{r}
    #| label: gbpoll-props

    # add code here
    ```

-   **Demo:** Recreate the visualization from the tweet.
    You do not need to worry about matching the colors precisely and your bars should be correctly scaled.

    ```{r}
    #| label: gbnews-plot-recreate

    # add code here
    ```

-   **Your turn (10 minutes):** Improve the visualization.
    State the improvements you made and why you made them.
    Discuss how these improvements help make the plot less misleading.

-   **Question:** What is misleading about this graph?

*Add your response here.*

-   **Your turn (6 minutes):** If you needed to recreate this plot, with improvements to avoid its misleading pitfalls, what data do you need? How many variables? How many observations? Can you find the data online? Try looking for it for at least 3 minutes with a partner.

*Add your response here.*

-   **Demo:** Load the data for this survey from `data/survation.csv`. First confirm that the data match the percentages from the visualization. Then, recreate the visualization, and improve it. Does the improved visualization look different than the original? Does it send a different message at a first glance?
