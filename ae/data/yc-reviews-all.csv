2.0 out of 5 stars Barely has any scent,"I'd rate this a 1-star but it looks nice when burning. Otherwise, it's entirely a branded product that doesn't deliver. There is hardly any scent at all, when unlit or burning. Complete waste of my money and I'm sorry I trusted the best seller ranking. Not going to return a halfway burned candle but lesson learned.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 15, 2022"

5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful!,"I've always loved this particular candle fragrance. But whoever ships them should be told to put them in a padded box, not a padded envelope. This one came broken in pieces. Too much trouble to send it back, so I put it in a dish and will burn it down as far as it goes. But overall, Yankee Candles are wonderful.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 14, 2022"

5.0 out of 5 stars Can't go wrong with a classic!,"I love Yankee Candle and have quite a few of these around my house already, but you can never go wrong with vanilla or cupcakes! Together? It's a winning combination. I have a very sensitive sense of smell, but this is one of the best scents ever.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 14, 2022"
1.0 out of 5 stars Gives off no scent,"This is the second Yankee Candle that I've bought that gives off very little scent. The candles are really hit-or-miss. I ordered a Kitchen Spice candle, and its fragrance fills the room. The Sparkling Cinnamon and the Balsam and Cedar ones that I ordered give off basically no scent at all. Yankee Candles used to be consistently good and worth the high price. Now, you're taking a chance any time you buy them.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 14, 2022"

1.0 out of 5 stars Slight scent but mostly just burnt wick,"This is the bottom of the barrel holiday scented candle. Burned for hours with nothing more then a burnt wick smell. We opened it brand new and it barley had a pumpkin scent to it. Would not buy this again, waist of money. Not sure if it’s The manufacture or the seller selling bad candles but this is a no go.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 14, 2022"

"3.0 out of 5 stars Nice, but weak","The scent is nice, but really weak compared to most Yankee Candles I've had. For autumn scents, Mulled Cider is way better.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 11, 2022"
5.0 out of 5 stars Pleasant autumn scent,"Yankee Candles' original large jar candles are my favorites. I like to set seasonal fragrances on the coffee table and enjoy their ambiance and scent to help set the seasonal mood. This spiced pumpkin candle offers a very pleasing autumnal blend of spices that sets the tone for fall, Halloween, and into the Thanksgiving season.Yankee Candle claims a burn time of 100 to 150 hours for these candles. It's difficult for me to verify that, but I can say that I have burned these large jar candles for 3 to 4 seasons, packing them away in gallon-sized zip lock bags to preserve their scents. There's lots of candle entries out there competing for your dollars, but I've found Yankee Candles to offer the best value and best scents. If you keep an eye out for particular scents on Amazon, you can find the original large jars for for $14 to $18, rather than the recent $25 to $40 prices.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 10, 2022"
1.0 out of 5 stars no scent,"No more Yankee Candles for me. This was my first. I'd heard how wonderful the fragrance is with this brand. Nope. I got the vanilla cupcake and all I smell is a weird chemical smell, nothing at all like vanilla or any cupcake I ever met. It has been burning for 2 hrs now, and ... nothing. I would go so far as to say is unpleasant.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 10, 2022"

5.0 out of 5 stars Doesn’t give me a headache.,"Many candles may initially smell good, but when burned even for a short time, give me a headache. I have given many candles away, even other Yankee candles, because off it. I love the smell of cinnamon and while the smell isn’t super strong, it is strong enough to make the area where I use it smell better.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 9, 2022"
5.0 out of 5 stars Such a great scent!!,"If you want a scent that smells exactly like autumn, this is it. It smells SOOOOO GOOD! I think it smells more cinnamon-y than pumpkin-y, which I am definitely okay with. However, it's very, very strong though (even unlit) so overpowered my small guest bathroom pretty quickly with the lid off. I moved it to my living room mantel so it could scent up the whole house and that was a much better idea!","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 9, 2022"

1.0 out of 5 stars Never before !,"I have ordered Yankee Candles from many retailers. A few were broken but it looked like the guts of a candle. On opening the box, I marveled at how well it was packed. Then I took out the candle and could not believe my eyes ! There was melted wax around the inner rim. That wax on top was oily looking. The wax in the canister is hard for me to describe. Color was layered in different shades of the candle color ( burnt orange ? ) I know that I got this candle at a discounted price but you should at least be able to burn it ! I have NEVER gotten anything from amazon so disgusting. Someone should check the item before shipping. Of course, I will return this supposed candle-------- Wish you had a "" 0 "" rating !","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 3, 2022"
5.0 out of 5 stars Where is the scent?,"I accidentally bought this scent as it was similar to Sugared Cinnamon Apple, which I had meant to buy. Not Amazon's fault at all so I kept it. It burns well and is pretty to watch but there is barely any scent! If you sniff the candle itself with your nose in the jar you can smell the cinnamon, but it does not diffuse into the air. It's basically like having an unscented candle. Next time I will be more careful!! The Sugared Cinnamon Apple has an AMAZING smell and it fills the room!","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 2, 2022"

1.0 out of 5 stars Quality Iffy - Buy at Your Own Risk,I wish I would have taken a photo when I received the package. I wanted to return it but my husband said ah no babe let’s give it a try. It was almost as if the candle had been melted once before (and no the package did not spend the day in the sun). The oil that holds the sent was and is significantly separated. It’s like light orange at the top and almost red at the bottom. I can kind of smell the sent but not like I normally would. I imagine that once we get toward the bottom of the candle it’s going to be like a spicy pumpkin hits me in the face.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2022"
5.0 out of 5 stars Sparkling Cinnamon smells like real cinnamon and cloves,"Sparkling Cinnamon smells wonderful! I wanted a cinnamon scented candle for the fall/Halloween season. I strongly dislike the artificial pumpkin and apple spice scents and wanted an authentic spice smell. This candle does smell like real cinnamon with a hint of cloves. The 22 oz jar is the standard large jar. I've only burned it once so far, but the wick lights well and the wax burns well.

For some reason if you purchase two of the same items you can only leave one review…SOOO, I added onto this review to make you aware!!! Maybe we all need to start shopping for our candles in the stores for our holiday gifts. You will be able to see both candles.

"3.0 out of 5 stars Great coming out of the gate, but not much for stamina","This candle had a pleasant scent but no matter how short the wick was trimmed, it burned quickly and left the wick long and caused it to leave soot around the rim of the jar. It also smelled very waxy after just a couple of hours of being lit. I had to keep blowing it out, letting it cool completely, re-trim the wick every 2 hours to get the same fresh candle smell.
